        "Title": "Chitin-glucan improves important pathophysiological features of irritable bowel syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most frequent and debilitating conditions leading to gastroenterological referrals. However, recommended treatments remain limited, yielding only limited therapeutic gains. Chitin-glucan (CG) is a novel dietary prebiotic classically used in humans at a dosage of 1.5-3.0 g/d and is considered a safe food ingredient by the European Food Safety Authority. To provide an alternative approach to managing patients with IBS, we performed preclinical molecular, cellular, and animal studies to evaluate the role of chitin-glucan in the main pathophysiological mechanisms involved in IBS. To evaluate the roles of CG in visceral analgesia, intestinal inflammation, barrier function, and to develop computational molecular models. Visceral pain was recorded through colorectal distension (CRD) in a model of long-lasting colon hypersensitivity induced by an intra-rectal administration of TNBS [15 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg)] in 33 Sprague-Dawley rats. Intracolonic pressure was regularly assessed during the 9 wk-experiment (weeks 0, 3, 5, and 7) in animals receiving CG (<i>n</i> = 14) at a human equivalent dose (HED) of 1.5 g/d or 3.0 g/d and compared to negative control (tap water, <i>n</i> = 11) and positive control (phloroglucinol at 1.5 g/d HED, <i>n</i> = 8) groups. The anti-inflammatory effect of CG was evaluated using clinical and histological scores in 30 C57bl6 male mice with colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) administered in their drinking water during 14 d. HT-29 cells under basal conditions and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were treated with CG to evaluate changes in pathways related to analgesia (\u00b5-opioid receptor (MOR), cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, inflammation [interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1b, and IL-8] and barrier function [mucin 2-5AC, claudin-2, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2] using the real-time PCR method. Molecular modelling of CG, LPS, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and phospholipomannan (PLM) was developed, and the ability of CG to chelate microbial pathogenic lipids was evaluated by docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Data were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Daily CG orally-administered to rats or mice was well tolerated without including diarrhea, visceral hypersensitivity, or inflammation, as evaluated at histological and molecular levels. In a model of CRD, CG at a dosage of 3 g/d HED significantly decreased visceral pain perception by 14% after 2 wk of administration (<i>P</i> < 0.01) and reduced inflammation intensity by 50%, resulting in complete regeneration of the colonic mucosa in mice with DSS-induced colitis. To better reproduce the characteristics of visceral pain in patients with IBS, we then measured the therapeutic impact of CG in rats with TNBS-induced inflammation to long-lasting visceral hypersensitivity. CG at a dosage of 1.5 g/d HED decreased visceral pain perception by 20% five weeks after colitis induction (<i>P</i> < 0.01). When the CG dosage was increased to 3.0 g/d HED, this analgesic effect surpassed that of the spasmolytic agent phloroglucinol, manifesting more rapidly within 3 wk and leading to a 50% inhibition of pain perception (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). The underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of CG involved, at least in part, a significant induction of MOR, CB2 receptor, and IL-10, as well as a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-8. CG also significantly upregulated barrier-related genes including muc5AC, claudin-2, and ZO-2. Molecular modelling of CG revealed a new property of the molecule as a chelator of microbial pathogenic lipids, sequestering gram-negative LPS and gram-positive LTA bacterial toxins, as well as PLM in fungi at the lowesr energy conformations. CG decreased visceral perception and intestinal inflammation through master gene regulation and direct binding of microbial products, suggesting that CG may constitute a new therapeutic strategy for patients with IBS or IBS-like symptoms.",

The use of this methodology in experimental therapy is driven by the ambition of improving the tolerability and PK properties of clinically-used therapeutic agents. The preclinical potential of bioorthogonal catalysis has been validated in\u2005vitro and in\u2005vivo with the in\u2005situ generation of a broad range of drugs, including cytotoxic agents, anti-inflammatory drugs and anxiolytics. In this article, we report our investigations towards the preparation of solid-supported Cu(I)-microdevices and their application in bioorthogonal uncaging and click reactions. A range of ligand-functionalized polymeric devices and off-on Cu(I)-sensitive sensors were developed and tested under conditions compatible with life. Last, we present a preliminary exploration of their use for the synthesis of PROTACs through CuAAC assembly of two heterofunctional mating units.",

        "Abstract": "Mobile health systems integrating wearable devices are emerging as promising tools for registering pain-related factors. However, their application in populations with chronic conditions has been underexplored. To design a semi-automatic mobile health system with wearable devices for evaluating the potential predictive relationship of pain qualities and thresholds with heart rate variability, skin conductance, perceived stress, and stress vulnerability in individuals with preclinical chronic pain conditions such as suspected rheumatic disease. A multicenter, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted with 67 elderly participants. Predicted variables were pain qualities and pain thresholds, assessed with the McGill Pain Questionnaire and a pressure algometer, respectively. Predictor variables were heart rate variability, skin conductance, perceived stress, and stress vulnerability. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the influence of the predictor variables on the pain dimensions. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the predictor variables significantly accounted for 27% of the variability in the affective domain, 14% in the miscellaneous domain, 15% in the total pain rating index, 10% in the number of words chosen, 14% in the present pain intensity, and 16% in the Visual Analog Scale scores. The study found significant predictive values of heart rate variability, skin conductance, perceived stress, and stress vulnerability in relation to pain qualities and thresholds in the elderly population with suspected rheumatic disease. The comprehensive integration of physiological and psychological stress measures into pain assessment of elderly individuals with preclinical chronic pain conditions could be promising for developing new preventive strategies.",

        "Title": "Natural products derived from herbs as promising source for diarrhea predominant-irritable bowel syndrome via gut microbiota-serotonin pathway.",
        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders, with diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D) as the most common subtype. Increasing evidence reported that the gut microbiota-mediated serotonin pathway plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of IBS-D. In this study, potential herbal medicine, plant extracts and its monomers that can be employed as the candidate molecules for IBS-D through gut microbiota-mediated serotonin pathway were reviewed. The bacteria indigenous to gut microbiota regulates serotonin pathway, mainly increasing tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) and decreasing serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), by activating cyclooxygenase/prostaglandin E2 (COX/PGE2) signaling. It further accelerated gastrointestinal motility and visceral hyperalgesia. Herbal medicine prescription including Tongxie yaofang and Shugan decoction, as well as some monomers of flavonoid and polyphenol compounds can be regarded as the potential agents for IBS-D. The predominate mechanisms were related to regulating serotonin pathway by driving on the specific bacterial abundance (such as Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes). However, there are few reports on which specific bacteria species play a regulatory role in serotonin pathway, and most of these effective agents were only evidenced by preclinical studies. We hope this review will provide some useful directions for the treatment strategy of IBS-D.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic abdominal pain in the absence of ongoing disease is the hallmark of disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs), including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). While the etiology of DGBIs remains poorly understood, there is evidence that both genetic and environmental factors play a role. In this study, we report the identification and validation of <i>Avpr1a</i> as a novel candidate gene for visceral hypersensitivity (VH), a primary peripheral mechanism underlying abdominal pain in DGBI/IBS. Comparing two C57BL/6 (BL/6) substrains (C57BL/6NTac and C57BL/6J) revealed differential susceptibility to the development of chronic VH following intrarectal zymosan (ZYM) instillation, a validated preclinical model for post-inflammatory IBS. Using whole genome sequencing, we identified a SNP differentiating the two strains in the 5' intergenic region upstream of <i>Avpr1a</i>, encoding the protein arginine-vasopressin receptor 1A (AVPR1A). We used behavioral, histological, and molecular approaches to identify distal colon-specific gene expression differences and neuronal hyperresponsiveness covarying with <i>Avpr1a</i> genotype and VH susceptibility. While the two BL/6 substrains did not differ across other gastrointestinal (GI) phenotypes (e.g., GI motility), VH-susceptible BL/6NTac mice had higher colonic <i>Avpr1a</i> mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, neurons of the enteric nervous system were hyperresponsive to the AVPR1A agonist AVP, suggesting a role for enteric neurons in the pathology underlying VH. These results parallel our findings that patients' colonic <i>Avpr1a</i> mRNA expression was higher in patients with higher pain ratings. Taken together, these findings implicate differential regulation of <i>Avpr1a</i> as a novel mechanism of VH-susceptibility as well as a potential therapeutic target specific to VH.",

        "Title": "Preclinical evaluation of bozepinib in bladder cancer cell lines: modulation of the NPP1 enzyme.",
        "Abstract": "Bladder cancer (BC) is the most common cancer of the urinary tract. Bozepinib (BZP), a purine-derived molecule, is a potential compound for the treatment of cancer. Purinergic signaling consists of the activity of nucleosides and nucleotides present in the extracellular environment, modulating a variety of biological actions. In cancer, this signaling is mainly controlled by the enzymatic cascade involving the NTPDase/E-NPP family and ecto-5'-nucleotidase/CD73, which hydrolyze extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine (ADO). The aim of this work is to evaluate the activity of BZP in the purinergic system in BC cell lines and to compare its in vitro antitumor activity with cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic drug widely used in the treatment of BC. In this study, two different BC cell lines, grade 1 RT4 and the more aggressive grade 3 T24, were used along with a human fibroblast cell line MRC-5, a cell used to predict the selectivity index (SI). BZP shows strong antitumor activity, with notable IC<sub>50</sub> values (8.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9 \u00b5M for RT4; 6.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 \u00b5M for T24), far from the SI for cisplatin (SI for BZP: 19.7 and 25.7 for RT4 and T24, respectively; SI for cisplatin: 1.7 for T24). BZP arrests T24 cells in the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase of the cell cycle, inducing early apoptosis. Moreover, BZP increases ATP and ADP hydrolysis and gene/protein expression of the NPP1 enzyme in the T24 cell line. In conclusion, BZP shows superior activity compared to cisplatin against BC cell lines in vitro.",

        "Abstract": "As diabetes rates surge globally, there is a corresponding rise in the number of patients suffering from diabetic kidney disease (DKD), a common complication of diabetes. DKD is a significant contributor to chronic kidney disease, often leading to end-stage renal failure. However, the effectiveness of current medical treatments for DKD leaves much to be desired. Molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) is an antioxidant that selectively reduces hydroxyl radicals, a reactive oxygen species with a very potent oxidative capacity. Recent studies have demonstrated that H<sub>2</sub> not only possesses antioxidant properties but also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, regulates cell lethality, and modulates signal transduction. Consequently, it is now being utilized in clinical applications. Many factors contribute to the onset and progression of DKD, with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation being strongly implicated. Recent preclinical and clinical trials reported that substances with antioxidant properties may slow the progression of DKD. Hence, we undertook a comprehensive review of the literature focusing on animal models and human clinical trials where H<sub>2</sub> demonstrated effectiveness against a variety of renal diseases. The collective evidence from this literature review, along with our previous findings, suggests that H<sub>2</sub> may have therapeutic benefits for patients with DKD by enhancing mitochondrial function. To substantiate these findings, future large-scale clinical studies are needed.",

        "Abstract": "Preclinical studies have shown that radiation therapy modulates antitumor immune responses. However, circulating T-cell responses after radiation therapy in patients with cancer have been poorly characterized. This study aims to explore the changes in circulating T cells after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Peripheral blood samples of 30 patients with breast cancer who underwent SBRT for bone metastasis were analyzed using multicolor flow cytometry. Phenotypes of PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and regulatory T (T<sub>REG</sub>) cells were examined. Additionally, plasma protein levels were analyzed using a bead-based immunoassay. Circulating PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which are enriched for tumor-specific clonotypes, were activated at 1 week after SBRT. However, circulating T<sub>REG</sub> cells were also activated after SBRT; this pattern was also evident among effector Foxp3<sup>hi</sup>CD45RA<sup>-</sup> T<sub>REG</sub> cells. We observed no difference in T-cell responses according to the fraction size and number. Notably, activation of T<sub>REG</sub> cells was more prominent in patients who experienced greater activation of PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Plasma level changes in TGF-\u03b21, soluble CTLA-4, and soluble 4-1BB at 1 week after SBRT were associated with PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. Activation of T<sub>REG</sub> cells at 1 week after SBRT was associated with worse progression-free survival. Clinical factors including molecular subtype were not associated with the T-cell responses. SBRT induced activation of both potentially tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and T<sub>REG</sub> cells, which were tightly associated with each other. These results may support the use of T<sub>REG</sub> cell-modulating strategies with SBRT to improve the antitumor immune response.",

        "Abstract": "Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) was the first histone demethylase discovered and the founding member of the flavin-dependent lysine demethylase family (KDM1). The human KDM1 family includes KDM1A and KDM1B, which primarily catalyze demethylation of histone H3K4me1/2. The KDM1 family is involved in epigenetic gene regulation and plays important roles in various biological and disease pathogenesis processes, including cell differentiation, embryonic development, hormone signaling, and carcinogenesis. Malfunction of many epigenetic regulators results in complex human diseases, including cancers. Regulators such as KDM1 have become potential therapeutic targets because of the reversibility of epigenetic control of genome function. Indeed, several classes of KDM1-selective small molecule inhibitors have been developed, some of which are currently in clinical trials to treat various cancers. In this chapter, we review the discovery, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms, atomic structure, genetics, biology, and pathology of the KDM1 family of lysine demethylases. Focusing on cancer, we also provide a comprehensive summary of recently developed KDM1 inhibitors and related preclinical and clinical studies to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of action and applications of these KDM1-specific inhibitors in therapeutic treatment.",

        "Title": "Patient-derived tumor models in cancer research: Evaluation of the oncostatic effects of melatonin.",
        "Abstract": "The development of new anticancer therapies tends to be very slow. Although their impact on potential candidates is confirmed in preclinical studies, \u223c95 % of these new therapies are not approved when tested in clinical trials. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of accurate preclinical models. In this context, there are different patient-derived models, which have emerged as a powerful oncological tool: patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), patient-derived organoids (PDOs), and patient-derived cells (PDCs). Although all these models are widely applied, PDXs, which are created by engraftment of patient tumor tissues into mice, is considered more reliable. In fundamental research, the PDX model is used to evaluate drug-sensitive markers and, in clinical practice, to select a personalized therapeutic strategy. Melatonin is of particular importance in the development of innovative cancer treatments due to its oncostatic impact and lack of adverse effects. However, the literature regarding the oncostatic effect of melatonin in patient-derived tumor models is scant. This review aims to describe the important role of patient-derived models in the development of anticancer treatments, focusing, in particular, on PDX models, as well as their use in cancer research. This review also summarizes the existing literature on the anti-tumoral effect of melatonin in patient-derived models in order to propose future anti-neoplastic clinical applications.",

        "Abstract": "The development of extracellular vesicles (EVs) therapies has revolutionized personalized medicine, opening up new possibilities for treatment. EVs have emerged as a promising therapeutic tool within this field due to their crucial role in intercellular communication across various cell types and organisms. This systematic review aims to evaluate the therapeutic potential of oral mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived EVs for bone regeneration, specifically focusing on findings from preclinical models. Sixteen articles meeting the inclusion criteria were selected following document analysis. The biological effects of oral MSC-derived EVs predominantly involve the upregulation of proteins associated with angiogenesis, and inflammation resolution, alongside the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, these therapeutic agents have been found to contain a significant quantity of different molecules (proteins, lipids, DNA, microRNAs, etc) further contributing to their modulatory potential. The findings from this systematic review underscore that oral MSC-derived EVs, irrespective of their specific population, have the ability to enhance the osteogenic repair response in maxillary bone or periodontal defects. In summary, this systematic review highlights the promising potential of oral MSC-derived EVs for bone regeneration based on evidence from preclinical models. The comprehensive assessment of their biological effects and the presence of microRNAs underscores their therapeutic significance. These findings support the utilization of oral MSC-derived EVs in enhancing the osteogenic repair response in various maxillary bone or periodontal defects, providing insights into the mechanisms involved and potential therapeutic applications in the field of personalized medicine.",

        "Abstract": "This study is to investigate whether dietary fiber intake prevents vascular and renal damage in a genetic mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and the contribution of gut microbiota in the protective effects. Female NZBWF1 (SLE) mice were treated with resistant-starch (RS) or inulin-type fructans (ITF). In addition, inoculation of fecal microbiota from these experimental groups to recipient normotensive female C57Bl/6J germ-free (GF) mice was performed. Both fiber treatments, especially RS, prevented the development of hypertension, renal injury, improved the aortic relaxation induced by acetylcholine, and the vascular oxidative stress. RS and ITF treatments increased the proportion of acetate- and butyrate-producing bacteria, respectively, improved colonic inflammation and integrity, endotoxemia, and decreased helper T (Th)17 proportion in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), blood, and aorta in SLE mice. However, disease activity (splenomegaly and anti-ds-DNA) was unaffected by both fibers. T cell priming and Th17 differentiation in MLNs and increased Th17 infiltration was linked to aortic endothelial dysfunction and hypertension after inoculation of fecal microbiota from SLE mice to GF mice, without changes in proteinuria and autoimmunity. All these effects were lower in GF mice after fecal inoculation from fiber-treated SLE mice. In conclusion, these findings support that fiber consumption prevented the development of hypertension by rebalancing of dysfunctional gut-immune system-vascular wall axis in SLE.",

        "Abstract": "The prenatal and early postnatal periods are stages during which dynamic changes and the development of the brain and gut microbiota occur, and nutrition is one of the most important modifiable factors that influences this process. Given the bidirectional cross talk between the gut microbiota and the brain through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), there is growing interest in evaluating the potential effects of nutritional interventions administered during these critical developmental windows on gut microbiota composition and function and their association with neurodevelopmental outcomes. We review recent preclinical and clinical evidence from animal studies and infant/child populations. Although further research is needed, growing evidence suggests that different functional nutrients affect the establishment and development of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and could have preventive and therapeutic use in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, more in-depth knowledge regarding the effect of nutrition on the MGBA during critical developmental windows may enable the prevention of later neurocognitive and behavioral disorders and allow the establishment of individualized nutrition-based programs that can be used from the prenatal to the early and middle stages of life.",

To enable the functional interrogation of cancer-associated SNVs, we developed a mouse system for temporal and regulatable in vivo base editing. The inducible base editing (iBE) mouse carries a single expression-optimized cytosine base editor transgene under the control of a tetracycline response element and enables robust, doxycycline-dependent expression across a broad range of tissues in vivo. Combined with plasmid-based or synthetic guide RNAs, iBE drives efficient engineering of individual or multiple SNVs in intestinal, lung and pancreatic organoids. Temporal regulation of base editor activity allows controlled sequential genome editing ex vivo and in vivo, and delivery of sgRNAs directly to target tissues facilitates generation of in situ preclinical cancer models.",

PubMed and Web of Science were searched for studies published on SNS and its clinical applications in fecal incontinence (limited to systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies), constipation (limited to reviews and randomized control clinical studies), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and upper gastrointestinal motility disorders. The relevant studies were pooled, and their findings were summarized and discussed. SNS is an approved method for treating fecal incontinence. Systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated high efficacy of the SNS therapy for fecal incontinence. Increased anal sphincter pressure and improvement in rectal sensation were reported as major mechanisms involved in the SNS therapy. SNS has also been proposed for treating constipation, but the therapy has been shown ineffective. There is a lack in SNS methodological optimization and mechanistic research. A few basic and clinical studies have reported the potential of SNS for treating visceral pain in IBS. SNS seemed capable of improving mucosal barrier functions. Several case reports are available in the literature on the treatment of IBD with SNS. Several laboratory studies suggested therapeutic potential of a special method of SNS for IBD. Cholinergic anti-inflammatory mechanisms were reported. Due to a recently reported spinal afferent and vagal efferent pathway of SNS, a few preclinical studies reported the potential of SNS for upper gastrointestinal motility disorders. However, no clinical studies have been performed. SNS for fecal incontinence is a well-established clinical therapy. However, the current method of SNS is ineffective for treating constipation. Further methodological development and randomized clinical trials are needed to explore potential applications of SNS for IBS and IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Visualization of focused ultrasound in high spatial and temporal resolution is crucial for accurately and precisely targeting brain regions noninvasively. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most widely used noninvasive tool for whole-brain imaging. However, focused ultrasound studies employing high-resolution (> 9.4 T) MRI in small animals are limited by the small size of the radiofrequency (RF) volume coil and the noise sensitivity of the image to external systems such as bulky ultrasound transducers. This technical note reports a miniaturized ultrasound transducer system packaged directly above a mouse brain for monitoring ultrasound-induced effects using high-resolution 9.4 T MRI. Our miniaturized system integrates MR-compatible materials with electromagnetic (EM) noise reduction techniques to demonstrate echo-planar imaging (EPI) signal changes in the mouse brain at various ultrasound acoustic intensities. The proposed ultrasound-MRI system will enable extensive research in the expanding field of ultrasound therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "The pharmacological treatment of cancer-related pain is unsatisfactory. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) has shown analgesia in preclinical models and clinical trials, but its clinical efficacy and safety have not been quantified. For this reason, our aim was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical evidence that was available. A systematic literature search was conducted in four electronic databases (Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov) up to 1 March 2023 in order to identify published clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and security of TTX in patients with cancer-related pain, including chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Five articles were selected, three of which were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The number of responders to the primary outcome (\u226530% improvement in the mean pain intensity) and those suffering adverse events in the intervention and placebo groups were used to calculate effect sizes using the log odds ratio. The meta-analysis showed that TTX significantly increased the number of responders (mean = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.19-1.16, <i>p</i> = 0.0065) and the number of patients suffering non-severe adverse events (mean = 1.13; 95% CI: 0.31-1.95, <i>p</i> = 0.0068). However, TTX did not increase the risk of suffering serious adverse events (mean = 0.75; 95% CI: -0.43-1.93, <i>p</i> = 0.2154). In conclusion, TTX showed robust analgesic efficacy but also increased the risk of suffering non-severe adverse events. These results should be confirmed in further clinical trials with higher numbers of patients.",

Despite treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and SGLT-2 inhibitors, the residual risk is substantial. There is preclinical and clinical evidence supporting a key role of mineralocorticoid receptor in cardiorenal injury in T2DM. Finerenone is a selective and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that reduces -on preclinical studies- heart and kidney inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical trials have demonstrated that among patients with T2DM and CKD, finerenone reduces CKD progression and the risk of cardiovascular events. The incidence of adverse events is similar than for placebo. Permanent discontinuation of study drug due to hyperkalemia was low (1.7% of finerenone and 0.6% of placebo participants) as was the risk of hyperkalemia-related severe-adverse events (1.1%). We provide an overview of risk factors for hyperkalemia and management of serum potassium in people with CKD and T2DM on finerenone. As finerenone increases potassium levels in a predictable way, patients at risk of hyperkalemia can be identified early in clinical practice and monitored for an easy management. This will allow people with T2DM and CKD to safely benefit from improved cardiorenal outcomes.",

        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, discomfort, and altered bowel habits, which affects the quality of life of approximately 10% of the worldwide population. IBS is classified into three types: IBS-D (diarrhea-predominant), IBS-C (constipation-predominant), and mixed or alternating IBS (IBS-M). Among the potential interventions for IBS-D, the antagonism of the serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor has recently emerged as an effective treatment option. Serotonin (5-HT) is a neurotransmitter and an immunoregulatory factor, which plays a key role in physiological and pathological processes of the human body, having an impact on intestinal motility and gland secretion, which assist in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. In this paper, the concept of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists in the treatment of individuals with IBS-D is discussed, with particular focus on mechanism of action and pre-clinical and clinical data. This study is based on pertinent papers that were retrieved by a selective search using relevant keywords in PubMed and ScienceDirect databases. Recent clinical trial data have confirmed beyond doubt the value of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists. As for future directions, weak partial 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor agonism appears to be an appealing alternative to a silent antagonist for the treatment of IBS-D.",

Nevertheless, there is a current lack of decellularization methods able to remove peripheral nerve cells without significantly altering the nerve extracellular matrix (ECM). The aims of this study are firstly to characterize <i>ex vivo</i>, in a histological, biochemical, biomechanical and ultrastructural way, three novel chemical-enzymatic decellularization protocols (P1, P2 and P3) in rat sciatic nerves and compared with the Sondell classic decellularization method and then, to select the most promising DPNAs to be tested <i>in vivo</i>. All the DPNAs generated present an efficient removal of the cellular material and myelin, while preserving the laminin and collagen network of the ECM (except P3) and were free from any significant alterations in the biomechanical parameters and biocompatibility properties. Then, P1 and P2 were selected to evaluate their regenerative effectivity and were compared with Sondell and autograft techniques in an <i>in vivo</i> model of sciatic defect with a 10-mm gap, after 15\u00a0weeks of follow-up. All study groups showed a partial motor and sensory recovery that were in correlation with the histological, histomorphometrical and ultrastructural analyses of nerve regeneration, being P2 the protocol showing the most similar results to the autograft control group.",

Among nanoparticles, lipid-based nanoplatforms possessing a lipid core, that is, lipid-core nanoparticles (LCNPs), have gained increasing interest due to lipid properties such as high solubilizing potential, versatility, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. However, due to the wide spectrum of morphologies and types of LCNPs, there is a lack of consensus regarding their terminology and classification. According to the current state-of-the-art in this critical review, LCNPs are defined and classified based on the state of their lipidic components in liquid lipid nanoparticles (LLNs). These include lipid nanoemulsions (LNEs) and lipid nanocapsules (LNCs), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid nanocarriers (NLCs). In addition, we present a comprehensive and comparative description of the methods employed for their preparation, routes of administration and the fundamental role of physicochemical properties of LCNPs for efficient antitumoral drug-delivery application.

        "Abstract": "Neurogenesis is a complex process by which neural progenitor cells (NPCs)/neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferate and differentiate into new neurons and other brain cells. In adulthood, the hippocampus is one of the areas with more neurogenesis activity, which is involved in the modulation of both emotional and cognitive hippocampal functions. This complex process is affected by many intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including nutrition. In this regard, preclinical studies performed in rats and mice demonstrate that high fats and/or sugars diets have a negative effect on adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). In contrast, diets enriched with bioactive compounds, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols, as well as intermittent fasting or caloric restriction, can induce AHN. Interestingly, there is also growing evidence demonstrating that offspring AHN can be affected by maternal nutrition in the perinatal period. Therefore, nutritional interventions from early stages and throughout life are a promising perspective to alleviate neurodegenerative diseases by stimulating neurogenesis. The underlying mechanisms by which nutrients and dietary factors affect AHN are still being studied. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that additional peripheral mediators may be involved. In this sense, the microbiota-gut-brain axis mediates bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain and could act as a link between nutritional factors and AHN. The aim of this mini-review is to summarize, the most recent findings related to the influence of nutrition and diet in the modulation of AHN. The importance of maternal nutrition in the AHN of the offspring and the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the nutrition-neurogenesis relationship have also been included.",

        "Abstract": "The primary purpose of this study was to assess the translatability of preclinical to early clinical tolerable and pharmacologically active dose ranges for central nervous system (CNS) active drugs. As a part of this, IBs were reviewed on reporting quality. Investigator's Brochures (IBs) of studies performed at the Centre for Human Drug Research (CHDR) reporting statistically significant results of CNS activity related to the drug's mechanism of action were included. The quality of IBs was assessed based on the presence of a rationale for the chosen animal model, completeness of pharmacokinetic (PK) results in reporting and internal validity information of the preclinical evidence. The IB-derisk tool was used to generate preclinical and early clinical data overviews data. For each compound, the overlap between pharmacologically active dose ranges and well-tolerated levels was calculated for three pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters: human equivalent dose (HED), maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and area under the curve (AUC). Twenty-five IBs were included. In general, the quality of reporting in IBs was assessed as poor. About a third of studies did not explore the entire concentration-effect curve (pre)clinically. Single dose tolerability ranges were most accurately predicted by C<sub>max</sub>. Human equivalent dose and AUC were the best predictors of pharmacologically active ranges. Tolerable and pharmacologically active dose ranges in healthy volunteers can be reasonably well predicted from preclinical data with the IB-derisk tool. The translatability of preclinical studies can be improved by applying a higher reporting standard in IBs including comparable PK measurements across all preclinical and clinical studies.",

        "Abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a natural and inevitable phenomenon that constitutes a severe threat to global public health and economy. Innovative products, active against new targets and with no cross- or co-resistance with existing antibiotic classes, novel mechanisms of action, or multiple therapeutic targets are urgently required. For these reasons, antimicrobial peptides such as bacteriocins constitute a promising class of new antimicrobial drugs under investigation for clinical development. Here, we review the potential therapeutic use of AS-48, a head-to-tail cyclized cationic bacteriocin produced by <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>. In the last few years, its potential against a wide range of human pathogens, including relevant bacterial pathogens and trypanosomatids, has been reported using <i>in vitro</i> tests and the mechanism of action has been investigated. AS-48 can create pores in the membrane of bacterial cells without the mediation of any specific receptor. However, this mechanism of action is different when susceptible parasites are studied and involves intracellular targets. Due to these novel mechanisms of action, AS-48 remains active against the antibiotic resistant strains tested. Remarkably, the effect of AS-48 against eukaryotic cell lines and in several animal models show little effect at the doses needed to inhibit susceptible species. The characteristics of this molecule such as low toxicity, microbicide activity, blood stability and activity, high stability at a wide range of temperatures or pH, resistance to proteases, and the receptor-independent effect make AS-48 unique to fight a broad range of microbial infections, including bacteria and some important parasites.",

        "Abstract": "<i>Background:</i> Prenatal ethanol exposure (PEE) induces heightened ethanol intake at adolescence in preclinical studies. Ethanol intake alters the absorption of folate, a methyl-group donor critical for numerous cellular functions. The prenatal administration of folate is, therefore, a promising approach to reduce the effects of PEE.<i>Objectives:</i> Experiment 1 determined if prenatal folate modulated the effects of PEE on ethanol intake, anxiety-like response, and exploratory behaviors (Experiment 1) in Wistar rats. Experiment 2 assessed, in rats not given PEE, if postnatal folate reversed effects of ethanol exposure at postnatal days 28-42. Experiment 3 assessed if folate altered blood ethanol levels (BELs).<i>Methods:</i> Experiment 1 involved 242 (125 male) adolescent Wistar rats derived from dams given folate (20\u2009mg/kg, gestational days - GD- 13-20)\u2009+\u2009ethanol (2.0\u2009g/kg, GD 17-20), ethanol, or vehicle only at pregnancy. Experiment 2 involved 29 male adolescents administered vehicle or ethanol doses co-administered or not with folate. In Experiment 3 twelve adult females were tested for BELs after folate administration. These tests were applied: intake tests, light dark box (LDB), elevated plus maze, open field and concentric square field.<i>Results:</i> PEE heightened ethanol intake (\u03b7<sup>2</sup> ps\u2009=\u20090.06-07) and induced hyperactivity and a reduced latency to exit the white area of the LDB (\u03b7<sup>2</sup> ps\u2009=\u20090.12-17). These effects were partially inhibited by folate (p\u2009>\u2009.05). Rats exposed to ethanol exposure at adolescence exhibited reduced motor activity (\u03b7<sup>2</sup> p\u2009=\u2009.17), regardless of folate treatment. Folate did not affect BELs.<i>Conclusion:</i> Folate administration should be considered as a preventive or acute treatment to attenuate the neurobehavioral effects of PEE.",

We aimed to identify a pattern of microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential early non-invasive markers of MPM. In a case-control study nested in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, we screened the whole miRNome in serum extracellular vesicles (EVs) of preclinical MPM cases. In a subgroup of 20 preclinical samples collected five years prior MPM diagnosis, we observed an upregulation of miR-11400 (fold change (FC) = 2.6, adjusted <i>p</i>-value = 0.01), miR-148a-3p (FC = 1.5, <i>p</i>-value = 0.001), and miR-409-3p (FC = 1.5, <i>p</i>-value = 0.04) relative to matched controls. The 3-miRNA panel showed a good classification capacity with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.81 (specificity = 0.75, sensitivity = 0.70). The diagnostic ability of the model was also evaluated in an independent retrospective cohort, yielding a higher predictive power (AUC = 0.86). A signature of EV miRNA can be detected up to five years before MPM; moreover, the identified miRNAs could provide functional insights into the molecular changes related to the late carcinogenic process, preceding MPM development.",

Altogether 119 patients meeting Rome IV criteria for IBS were included, of whom 118 received the supplement. The majority of patients (71.8% (95% CI 63.6\u221279.9%)) manifested a \u226530% decrease in abdominal pain at 4 weeks, the mean abdominal pain score diminishing by 54.2% (from 5.3 \u00b1 2.2 to 2.2 \u00b1 2.4, p < 0.0001).

        "Abstract": "Ethanol drinking begins during adolescence and, particularly when occurs in a binge-like pattern, exerts lingering adverse consequences. Pre-clinical studies indicate that intermittent ethanol exposure (IEA, a model of repeated ethanol intoxication), or binge eating (BE) can increase subsequent ethanol consumption. It is unknown if the promoting effects of BE upon ethanol drinking are found in female rats and are modulated by IEA at adolescence. This study assessed interactive effects between IEA and BE, upon ethanol drinking. Female Wistar rats were given 4.0\u00a0g/kg ethanol, every other day from postnatal day 25-45. At adulthood, they were exposed to sessions in which a brief offering of a sizeable portion of highly palatable sugary pills was followed by a 120-min exposure to an ethanol bottle. Exploratory activity and recognition memory was not affected by the IEA. Glutathione peroxidase and catalase activity, and lipid peroxidation (measured in blood and brain at the end of the procedure) were not significantly affected by IEA or BE exposure. BE alone had a mild promoting effect on ethanol ingestion. Those rats that underwent IEA and BE, however, exhibited heightened and sustained ethanol self-administration (average of 2.12\u00a0g/kg/120\u00a0min, vs 1.15\u00a0g/kg/120\u00a0min of the other groups), that persisted throughout the BE sessions. IEA and a history of BE also promoted ethanol intake or preference in a two-bottle endpoint test. The study suggests that exposure to IEA exerts, when followed by BE at adulthood, promoting effects upon ethanol intake, particularly at concentrations \u2265\u00a06%.",

        "Abstract": "The role of the NFL-TBS.40-63 peptide is to destroy the microtubule network of target glioma cancer cells. Recently, we have conceived a gold-complex biotinylated NFL-TBS.40-63 (BIOT-NFL) to form a hybrid gold nanovector (BIOT-NFL-PEG-AuNPs). This methodology showed, for the first time, the ability of the BIOT-NFL-PEG-AuNPs to target the destruction of pancreatic cancer cells (PDAC) under experimental conditions, as well as detoxification and preclinical therapeutic efficacy regulated by the steric and chemical configuration of the peptide. For this aim, a mouse transplantation tumor model induced by MIA-PACA-2 cells was applied to estimate the therapeutic efficacy of BIOT-NFL-PEG-AuNPs as a nanoformulation. Our relevant results display that BIOT-NFL-PEG-AuNPs slowed the tumor growth and decreased the tumor index without effects on the body weight of mice with an excellent antiangiogenic effect, mediated by the ability of BIOT-NFL-PEG-AuNPs to alter the metabolic profiles of these MIA-PACA-2 cells. The cytokine levels were detected to evaluate the behavior of serum inflammatory factors and the power of BIOT-NFL-PEG-AuNPs to boost the immune system.",

        "Title": "Bioactive compounds in childhood obesity and associated metabolic complications: Current evidence, controversies and perspectives.",
        "Abstract": "Obesity represents the most frequent chronic disease among children worldwide, with a significant global burden on society. Metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) can affect children since their first years of life, and novel therapeutic strategies to tackle metabolic complications are under investigation. This review focuses on bioactive compounds and their possible beneficial effects on obesity, particularly omega-3, docosahexaenoic acid, vitamin D, biotics, polysaccharide macromolecules, polyphenols, inositols, alpha lipoic acid, and bromelaine. Our aim is to summarize current evidence about bioactive compounds in the treatment of obesity, highlighting recent findings on their use in children and adolescents. Most studied molecules are omega-3 and vitamin D, despite the heterogeneity between the studies. Moreover, given the emerging interest in the gut-brain axis in the link between metabolic health and microbiota, various studies on prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics and polysaccharide macromolecules have been considered. Some preclinical studies seem to highlight a possible role of the polyphenols, even if their clinical evidence is still discussed. Lastly, we describe possible effects of inositols and alpha-lipoic acid. Despite some dietary supplements seem to be promising in overweight subjects, only in a few of them a dose/response efficacy has been found in the pediatric age. Innovative, well-designed and targeted clinical trials are then needed to prove the beneficial effects of these compounds that could support the standard behavioral therapy for obesity.",

        "Abstract": "Pre-clinical studies suggest that circulating oxylipins, i.e., the oxidation products of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), modulate gut microbiota composition in mice, but there is no information available in humans. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between omega-3 and omega-6 derived oxylipins plasma levels and fecal microbiota composition in a cohort of young adults. 80 young adults (74% women; 21.9 \u00b1 2.2 years old) were included in this cross-sectional study. Plasma levels of oxylipins were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by V3-V4 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We observed that plasma levels of omega-3 derived oxylipins were positively associated with the relative abundance of <i>Clostridium cluster IV</i> genus (<i>Firmicutes</i> phylum; rho \u2265 0.415, <i>p</i> \u2264 0.009) and negatively associated with the relative abundance of <i>Sutterella</i> genus (Proteobacteria phylum; rho \u2265 -0.270, <i>p</i> \u2264 0.041), respectively. Moreover, plasma levels of omega-6 derived oxylipins were negatively associated with the relative abundance of <i>Acidaminococcus</i> and <i>Phascolarctobacterium</i> genera (<i>Firmicutes</i> phylum; all rho \u2265 -0.263, <i>p</i> \u2264 0.024), as well as <i>Sutterella</i>, <i>Succinivibrio</i>, and <i>Gemmiger</i> genera (<i>Proteobacteria</i> phylum; all rho \u2265 -0.263, <i>p</i> \u2264 0.024). Lastly, the ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins plasma levels was negatively associated with the relative abundance of <i>Clostridium</i> cluster IV genus (<i>Firmicutes</i> phylum; rho = -0.334, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and <i>Butyricimonas</i> genus (<i>Bacteroidetes</i> phylum; rho = -0.292, <i>p</i> = 0.014). In conclusion, our results show that the plasma levels of omega-3 and omega-6 derived oxylipins are associated with the relative abundance of specific fecal bacteria genera.",

        "Abstract": "Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive cancer mainly caused by asbestos exposure. Specific and sensitive noninvasive biomarkers may facilitate and enhance screening programs for the early detection of cancer. We investigated DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles in MPM prediagnostic blood samples in a case-control study nested in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) cohort, aiming to characterise DNAm biomarkers associated with MPM. From the EPIC cohort, we included samples from 135 participants who developed MPM during 20\u2009years of follow-up and from 135 matched, cancer-free, controls. For the discovery phase we selected EPIC participants who developed MPM within 5\u2009years from enrolment (n\u00a0=\u00a036) with matched controls. We identified nine differentially methylated CpGs, selected by 10-fold cross-validation and correlation analyses: cg25755428 (MRI1), cg20389709 (KLF11), cg23870316, cg13862711 (LHX6), cg06417478 (HOOK2), cg00667948, cg01879420 (AMD1), cg25317025 (RPL17) and cg06205333 (RAP1A). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the model including baseline characteristics (age, sex and PC1wbc) along with the nine MPM-related CpGs has a better predictive value for MPM occurrence than the baseline model alone, maintaining some performance also at more than 5\u2009years before diagnosis (area under the curve [AUC]\u2009<\u20095\u2009years\u00a0=\u00a00.89; AUC 5-10\u2009years\u00a0=\u00a00.80; AUC >10\u2009years\u00a0=\u00a00.75; baseline AUC range\u00a0=\u00a00.63-0.67). DNAm changes as noninvasive biomarkers in prediagnostic blood samples of MPM cases were investigated for the first time. Their application can improve the identification of asbestos-exposed individuals at higher MPM risk to possibly adopt more intensive monitoring for early disease identification.",

        "Abstract": "Background Dietary polyphenol intake has been associated with a decreased risk of hyperuricemia, but most of this knowledge comes from preclinical studies. The aim of the present study was to assess the association of the intake of different classes of polyphenols with serum uric acid and hyperuricemia. Methods and Results This cross-sectional analysis involved baseline data of 6332 participants. Food polyphenol content was estimated by a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and from the Phenol-Explorer database. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models with serum uric acid (milligrams per deciliter) as the outcome and polyphenol intake (quintiles) as the main independent variable were fitted. Cox regression models with constant follow-up time (t=1) were performed to estimate the prevalence ratios (PRs) of hyperuricemia (\u22657\u2009mg/dL in men and \u22656\u2009mg/dL in women). An inverse association between the intake of the phenolic acid class (\u03b2 coefficient, -0.17\u2009mg/dL for quintile 5 versus quintile 1 [95% CI, -0.27 to -0.06]) and hydroxycinnamic acids (\u03b2 coefficient, -0.19 [95% CI, -0.3 to -0.09]), alkylmethoxyphenols (\u03b2 coefficient, -0.2 [95% CI, -0.31 to -0.1]), and methoxyphenols (\u03b2 coefficient,\u00a0-0.24 [95% CI, -0.34 to -0.13]) subclasses with serum uric acid levels and hyperuricemia (PR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.71-0.95]; PR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.71-0.95]; PR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.70-0.92]; and PR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69-0.91]; respectively) was found. The intake of hydroxybenzoic acids was directly and significantly associated with mean serum uric acid levels (\u03b2 coefficient, 0.14 for quintile 5 versus quintile 1 [95% CI, 0.02-0.26]) but not with hyperuricemia. Conclusions In individuals with metabolic syndrome, a higher intake of some polyphenol subclasses (hydroxycinnamic acids, alkylmethoxyphenol, and methoxyphenol) was inversely associated with serum uric acid levels and hyperuricemia. Nevertheless, our findings warrant further research.",

        "Abstract": "This present study evaluates the pre-clinical evidence on the efficacy of NS/PC and scaffold (NS/PC + scaffold) transplantation on locomotor recovery after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Two independent reviewers screened the records gathered through a systematic search in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Sciences databases. Studies on rats/mice evaluating the efficacy of simultaneous transplantation of NS/PCs and scaffold in the treatment of SCI were included. The results were reported as standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Forty-seven articles were retrieved. Analyses showed that NS/PC + scaffold transplantation significantly improved locomotion in animals with SCI compared to that of the non-treatment group (SMD = 2.71, 95% CI: 1.89 to 3.54; I<sup>2</sup> = 95.15%, p < 0.0001), scaffold alone (SMD = 2.28; 95% CI: 1.56 to 3.00; I<sup>2</sup> = 94.38%; p < 0.0001), and NS/PCs alone (SMD = 1.74, 95% CI: 0.64 to 2.83; I<sup>2</sup> = 92.02%, p < 0.0001). Moreover, the effectiveness of the treatment significantly increases when PLGA-based scaffolds and antibiotics are used. In addition, the NS/PC + scaffold transplantation during the first week after injury led to a significant improvement in locomotion, while concomitant transplantation of NS/PC + scaffold did not improve locomotion in cervical lesions. The findings showed that using NS/PCs with scaffold not only improves locomotion recovery, but also is superior to NS/PCs alone and scaffold alone. Future experiments and translational clinical studies are recommended to focus on the assessment of the safety and efficacy of the application of NS/PC + scaffold on SCI recovery.",

Although not life-threatening, IBS has a long course and recurrent attacks and seriously affects the life quality of patients. Current drugs for treating IBS possess remarkable limitations, such as limited efficacy and severe adverse reactions. Therefore, developing novel medications to treat IBS is quite essential, and natural products may be a substantial source. This is the first systematic review elaborating the recent advancement of natural products as potential drugs for the therapy of IBS. A comprehensive retrieval of studies was carried out in scientific databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Elsevier, and CNKI. By using (\"irritable bowel syndrome\" OR \"IBS\") AND (\"natural product\" OR \"natural compound\" OR \"phytochemical\") as keywords, the eligible studies were screened, and the relevant information about therapeutic action and mechanism of natural products treating IBS was extracted. Natural products against IBS consisted of four categories, namely, terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, and phenols. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms for natural products treating IBS were tightly associated with increased TJs and mucus protein expression, regulation of the brain-gut axis and gut microbiota structure, and inhibition of inflammatory response and intestinal mucosal damage. Natural products could be extremely prospective candidate drugs used to treat IBS, and further preclinical and clinical researches are needed to guarantee their efficacy and safety.",

Recent studies have indicated that the reporting of preclinical evidence presented in IBs does not enable proper risk-benefit assessment. We interviewed different stakeholders (regulators, research ethics committee members, preclinical and clinical researchers, ethicists, and metaresearchers) about their views on measures to increase the completeness and robustness of preclinical evidence reporting in IBs. This study was preregistered (https://osf.io/nvzwy/). We used purposive sampling and invited stakeholders to participate in an online semistructured interview between March and June 2021. Themes were derived using inductive content analysis. We used a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats matrix to categorize our findings. Twenty-seven international stakeholders participated. The interviewees pointed to several strengths and opportunities to improve completeness and robustness, mainly more transparent and systematic justifications for the included studies. However, weaknesses and threats were mentioned that could undermine efforts to enable a more thorough assessment: The interviewees stressed that current review practices are sufficient to ensure the safe conduct of first-in-human trials. They feared that changes to the IB structure or review process could overburden stakeholders and slow drug development. In principle, more robust decision-making processes align with the interests of all stakeholders and with many current initiatives to increase the translatability of preclinical research and limit uninformative or ill-justified trials early in the development process. Further research should investigate measures that could be implemented to benefit all stakeholders.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stenting for branch pulmonary artery stenosis using a biodegradable nitride iron stent (IBS<sup>\u00ae</sup> Angel\u2122) and right ventricular systolic and diastolic function. From July 2021 to February 2022, a total of 11 cases (ages ranged from 36 to 86 months old) were included in this pre and post-intervention, prospective, cohort and preclinical study. All cases underwent transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE), chest radiography, along with computed tomography (256-slice scanner, multiple-detector) and right heart catheterization. Different types of biodegradable nitride iron stents were implanted. TTE was performed serially 1 day, 1 month and 3 months after the procedure to evaluate the rate of restenosis and right ventricular function. Stenting was successful in 11 patients. There were no major adverse cardiovascular events related to the device or to the procedure. Blood perfusion in the branch pulmonary artery was improved immediately. At follow-up, there was no significant restenosis that required re-intervention. None of the patients suffered from in-stent thrombosis, vascular embolism, stent displacement or heart failure. Compared with normal values, there were statistical with regards to FAC, E/A and E'/A'. Furthermore, we found that TAPSE correlated significantly with pulsed Doppler S wave (<i>p</i> = 0.008) and left ventricular ejection fraction (<i>p</i> < 0.01). The early trans-tricuspid inflow velocities E/E' (tissue doppler at the lateral tricuspid annulus) correlated significantly with E'/A' (<i>p</i> = 0.009). FAC and E'/A' were statistically different from those prior to stenting (<i>p</i> = 0.041 and <i>p</i> = 0.035) when tested one month postoperatively. At three months postoperatively, only E/A showed a statistical difference (<i>p</i> = 0.015). Our analysis suggests that biodegradable nitride iron stents are feasible, safe, and effective in children. Some small improvements were observed in right ventricular systolic and diastolic function after successful transcatheter intervention, although change was not statistically significant due to the small sample number.

This proof-of-concept study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the \u03b2<sub>3</sub> -adrenergic agonist vibegron in treating IBS-related pain. Adult women with predominant-diarrhea IBS (IBS-D) or with mixed diarrhea/constipation (IBS-M), diagnosed using Rome IV criteria, were randomized 1:1 to receive once-daily vibegron 75\u00a0mg or placebo for 12\u00a0weeks. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with IBS-D considered abdominal pain intensity (API) weekly responders, defined as \u226530% reduction from baseline at week 12 in mean weekly worst abdominal pain over 24\u00a0hours using the API score. Patients completed a pain diary at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs) in the overall IBS population. Of the 222 patients with IBS randomized (vibegron, N\u00a0=\u00a0111; placebo, N\u00a0=\u00a0111), 85% completed the trial. There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with IBS-D (vibegron, N\u00a0=\u00a066; placebo, N\u00a0=\u00a063) considered API weekly responders with vibegron vs. placebo (p\u00a0=\u00a00.8222) after 12\u00a0weeks. The incidence of AEs was comparable between treatment groups (33.3% each), with equal rates of worsening IBS symptoms (2.7% each). In women with IBS-D, vibegron was not associated with significant improvement in the percentage of API weekly responders. Vibegron was generally safe and well tolerated and, in particular, did not worsen IBS symptoms vs. placebo.",

        "Abstract": "Lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1; also known as KDM1A), is an epigenetic modulator that modifies the histone methylation status. KDM1A forms a part of protein complexes that regulate the expression of genes involved in the onset and progression of diseases such as cancer, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, viral infections, and others. Vafidemstat (ORY-2001) is a clinical stage inhibitor of KDM1A in development for the treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. However, the role of ORY-2001 targeting KDM1A in neuroinflammation remains to be explored. Here, we investigated the effect of ORY-2001 on immune-mediated and virus-induced encephalomyelitis, two experimental models of multiple sclerosis and neuronal damage. Oral administration of ORY-2001 ameliorated clinical signs, reduced lymphocyte egress and infiltration of immune cells into the spinal cord, and prevented demyelination. Interestingly, ORY-2001 was more effective and/or faster acting than a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor antagonist in the effector phase of the disease and reduced the inflammatory gene expression signature characteristic ofEAE in the CNS of mice more potently. In addition, ORY-2001 induced gene expression changes concordant with a potential neuroprotective function in the brain and spinal cord and reduced neuronal glutamate excitotoxicity-derived damage in explants. These results pointed to ORY-2001 as a promising CNS epigenetic drug able to target neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases and provided preclinical support for the subsequent design of early-stage clinical trials.",

        "Title": "Depression in Adolescence and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor.",
        "Abstract": "The incidence of depression among adolescents has been rapidly increasing in recent years. Environmental and genetic factors have been identified as important risk factors for adolescent depression. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of adolescent depression that are triggered by these risk factors are not well understood. Clinical and preclinical studies have focused more on adult depression, and differences in depressive symptoms between adolescents and adults make it difficult to adequately diagnose and treat adolescent depression. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of many psychiatric disorders, including depression. However, there are still few studies on adolescent depression. Therefore, in this review paper, the causes and treatment of adolescent depression and the function of BDNF are investigated.",

        "Abstract": "In preclinical and clinical studies, it has been demonstrated that tumor-educated platelets play a critical role in tumorigenesis, cancer development, and metastasis. Unlike the role of cancer-derived chemokines in platelet activation, the role of cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) has remained elusive. Here, we found that interleukin-8 (IL-8) in cancer-derived EVs contributed to platelet activation by increasing P-selectin expression and ligand affinity, resulting in increased platelet adhesion on the human vessel-mimicking microfluidic system. Furthermore, platelet adhesion levels on vessels treated with human plasma-derived EVs demonstrated good discrimination between breast cancer patients with metastasis and those without, with the area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.88. While EpCAM expression on EVs could detect the existence of a tumor (AUC = 0.89), it performed poorly in predicting metastasis (AUC = 0.42). We believe that these findings shed light on the role of the interaction between cancer-derived EVs and platelets in pre-metastatic niche formation and tumor metastasis, potentially leading to the development of platelet-tumor interaction-based novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

        "Title": "Latrophilin-2 is a novel receptor of LRG1 that rescues vascular and neurological abnormalities and restores diabetic erectile function.",
        "Abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by inappropriate hyperglycemia, which causes endothelial dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy, ultimately leading to multiple complications. One prevalent complication is diabetic erectile dysfunction (ED), which is more severe and more resistant to treatment than nondiabetic ED. The serum glycoprotein leucine-rich \u0251-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) is a modulator of TGF-\u03b2-mediated angiogenesis and has been proposed as a biomarker for a variety of diseases, including DM. Here, we found that the adhesion GPCR latrophilin-2 (LPHN2) is a TGF-\u03b2-independent receptor of LRG1. By interacting with LPHN2, LRG1 promotes both angiogenic and neurotrophic processes in mouse tissue explants under hyperglycemic conditions. Preclinical studies in a diabetic ED mouse model showed that LRG1 administration into the penile tissue, which exhibits significantly increased LPHN2 expression, fully restores erectile function by rescuing vascular and neurological abnormalities. Further investigations revealed that PI3K, AKT, and NF-\u03baB p65 constitute the key intracellular signaling pathway of the LRG1/LPHN2 axis, providing important mechanistic insights into LRG1-mediated angiogenesis and nerve regeneration in DM. Our findings suggest that LRG1 can be a potential new therapeutic option for treating aberrant peripheral blood vessels and neuropathy associated with diabetic complications, such as diabetic ED.",

        "Abstract": "Preclinical data indicate that bergamot essential oil (BEO) can modulate the synaptic functions within the central nervous system (CNS). Particularly, several data shows that essential oil is endowed with reproducible analgesic and anxiolytic effects that may derived from the ability to modulate the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the CNS. Although there are differences in the functional complexity of the enteric nervous system (ENS), it is likely that the phytocomplex has biological properties in gut superimposable to those showed in the CNS. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate ex-vivo the effect of bergamot essential oil and its main constituents on the contractile activity of rat isolated colon, jejunum and ileum induced by different muscle stimulants such as acetylcholine (10<sup>-6</sup> M) and potassium chloride (80 mM). Our present data demonstrate that BEO inhibits cholinergically- and non cholinergically-mediated contractions in rat isolated gut and that linalool is the most active component. These results suggest that the phytocomplex might be useful in the treatment of spastic disorders in ENS mainly characterized by the presence of pain; incidentally, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a painful condition in which a role for neurotransmitter dysfunction has been envisaged. More investigation is required for clinical translation of the present data.",

        "Abstract": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulators have recently received increased attention as potential therapeutics for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, we tested a novel NMDAR-positive modulator, NYX-783, in the following two rodent models of PTSD: an auditory fear-conditioning model and a single-prolonged stress (SPS) model. We examined the ability of NYX-783 to reduce subsequent fear-based behaviors by measuring enhanced fear extinction and reduced spontaneous recovery (spontaneous return of fear) in male mice. NYX-783 administration significantly reduced spontaneous recovery in both PTSD models and enhanced fear extinction in the SPS model. Furthermore, NYX-783 increased the NMDA-induced inward currents of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (IL mPFC) and that the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs on pyramidal neurons in the IL mPFC is required for its effect on spontaneous recovery. The downstream expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor was required for NYX-783 to achieve its behavioral effect. These results elucidate the cellular targets of NYX-783 and the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition of spontaneous recovery. These preclinical findings support the hypothesis that NYX-783 may have therapeutic potential for PTSD treatment and may be particularly useful for inhibiting spontaneous recovery.",

        "Abstract": "Migraine is a common disease worldwide, and recent studies showed that the incidence of migraine was increased in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. In addition, preclinical evidence suggested a bidirectional relationship between the GI nervous system and the central nervous system called the gut\u2212brain axis. This study aimed to determine the association between several high-prevalence GI diseases and migraine. Patients diagnosed with migraine or GI diseases were classified as the patient group at least twice a year. We included peptic ulcer disease, dyspepsia, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and gastroesophageal disease as GI diseases. A total of 781,115 patients from the HIRA dataset were included in the study. The prevalence of migraine was about 3.5 times higher in patients with one or more GI diseases after adjusting for age, gender, and insurance type (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj = 3.46, 95% CI: 3.30\u22123.63, p < 0.001). In addition, the prevalence of migraine was increased as the number of comorbid GI diseases increased. The prevalence of GI disease was also higher in patients with medication for migraine, both preventive and acute treatment, compared to patients with either acute preventive or acute treatment. There was a statistically significant association between the prevalence of GI diseases and migraine, and the higher the number of accompanying GI diseases, the higher the correlation was in patients using both preventive and acute treatment drugs for migraine.",

        "Title": "Potential Roles of Enterochromaffin Cells in Early Life Stress-Induced Irritable Bowel Syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders, also known as disorders of the gut-brain interaction; however, the pathophysiology of IBS remains unclear. Early life stress (ELS) is one of the most common risk factors for IBS development. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ELS induces IBS remain unclear. Enterochromaffin cells (ECs), as a prime source of peripheral serotonin (5-HT), play a pivotal role in intestinal motility, secretion, proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, and visceral sensation. ECs can sense various stimuli and microbiota metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and secondary bile acids. ECs can sense the luminal environment and transmit signals to the brain via exogenous vagal and spinal nerve afferents. Increasing evidence suggests that an ECs-5-HT signaling imbalance plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ELS-induced IBS. A recent study using a maternal separation (MS) animal model mimicking ELS showed that MS induced expansion of intestinal stem cells and their differentiation toward secretory lineages, including ECs, leading to ECs hyperplasia, increased 5-HT production, and visceral hyperalgesia. This suggests that ELS-induced IBS may be associated with increased ECs-5-HT signaling. Furthermore, ECs are closely related to corticotropin-releasing hormone, mast cells, neuron growth factor, bile acids, and SCFAs, all of which contribute to the pathogenesis of IBS. Collectively, ECs may play a role in the pathogenesis of ELS-induced IBS. Therefore, this review summarizes the physiological function of ECs and focuses on their potential role in the pathogenesis of IBS based on clinical and pre-clinical evidence.",

        "Abstract": "Drug repurposing can be a successful approach to deal with the scarcity of cost-effective therapies in situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Tetracyclines have previously shown efficacy in preclinical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) models and initial predictions and experimental reports suggest a direct antiviral activity against SARS-CoV2. Furthermore, a few clinical reports indicate their potential in COVID-19 patients. In addition to the scarcity and limitations of the scientific evidence, the effectiveness of tetracyclines in experimental ARDS has been proven extensively, counteracting the overt inflammatory reaction and fibrosis sequelae due to a synergic combination of pharmacological activities. This paper discusses the scientific evidence behind the application of tetracyclines for ARDS/COVID-19. The benefits of their multi-target pharmacology and their safety profile overcome the limitations, such as antibiotic activity and low commercial interest. Immunomodulatory tetracyclines and novel chemically modified non-antibiotic tetracyclines have therapeutic potential. Further drug repurposing studies in ARDS and severe COVID-19 are necessary.",

        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) are common gastrointestinal disorders imposing considerable impact on the quality of life and well-being of affected individuals. A paucity of evidence-based treatment options exist for CIC and IBS-C sufferers. Tegaserod, a 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonist, has a substantial body of preclinical and clinical study evidence to support its beneficial role in modulating sensorimotor function of the luminal gastrointestinal tract. Tegaserod was first approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the management of IBS-C and CIC in 2002 and 2004, respectively. Tegaserod enjoyed a successful uptake in the management of these disorders during its first several years of availability in the United States, but was later withdrawn from the market in 2007 over concerns related to adverse cardiovascular events. Since then, additional safety data has been generated, and following a resubmission and review by the Food and Drug Administration, in April 2019, tegaserod was once again approved for use in IBS-C under a more restricted labeling, confining use to women under 65 years of age without heart disease or additional cardiovascular risk factors. This review summarizes the regulatory journey of tegaserod and details the existing pharmacokinetic, physiologic, clinical, and safety data of tegaserod generated over the last 2 decades. The discussion also examines the future of tegaserod in the treatment of these constipation disorders, as well as its potential role in other related disorders of brain-gut interaction.",

        "Abstract": "A herbal formula Tong-Xie-Yao-Fang (TXYF) is traditionally used to treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), modern pharmacological evidence supports that the formula efficacy is associated with altered gut microbiota. Yet, the mechanistic role of gut microbiota in the therapy of TXYF remains unclear. We previously clarified that gut microbiota-dysregulated bile acid (BA) metabolism contribute to the pathogenesis of IBS, deriving a hypothesis that microbiota-BA metabolic axis might be a potential target of TXYF. We aim to investigate a new gut microbiota-mediated mechanism underlying anti-IBS efficacy of TXYF. We established an IBS rat model with a combination of stressors, compared the herbal efficacy in models undergone gut bacterial manipulations, also examined BA metabolism-related microbiota, metabolites, genes and proteins by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, targeted metabolomics, qPCR and multiplex immunofluorescence staining. We observed that TXYF attenuated visceral hyperalgesia and diarrhea in IBS rats but not in those underwent gut bacteria depletion. Transferring gut microbiota from TXYF-treated donors also decreased visceral sensitivity and slightly relief diarrhea-like behaviors in IBS recipient rats. Fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that TXYF modulated microbial \u03b2-diversity and taxonomic structure of IBS rats, with a significant increase in relative abundance of bile salt hydrolase (BSH)-expressing Bacteroidaceae. qPCR and culturing data validated that TXYF had a promotive effect on the growth and BSH activity of Bacteroides species. TXYF-reshaped microbiota upregulated the expression of intestinal Fgf15, a feedback signal to control BA synthesis in the liver. As a result, the BA synthetic and excretory levels in IBS rats were decreased by TXYF, so as that colonic BA membrane receptor Tgr5 sensing and its mediated Calcitonin gene-related peptide (Cgrp)-positive neuronal response were attenuated. This study poses a new microbiota-driven therapeutic action for TXYF, highlighting the potential of developing new anti-IBS strategies from the herbal formula targeting BSH-expressing gut bacteria.",

        "Abstract": "Chang-Kang-Fang (CKF), originated from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas, has been utilized to treat diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) based on clinical experience. However, the underlying mechanism of CKF for treating IBS-D remains unclear and need further clarification. The objective of this present investigation was to validate the efficacy of CKF on IBS-D model rats and to uncover its potential mechanism for the treatment of IBS-D. We first established the IBS-D rat model through neonatal maternal separation (NMS) in combination with restraint stress (RS) and the administration of senna decoction via gavage. To confirm the therapeutic effect of CKF on treating IBS-D, abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores, the quantity of fecal pellets, and the fecal water content (FWC) were measured to evaluate the influence of CKF on visceral hypersensitivity and the severity of diarrhea symptom after the intragastric administration of CKF for 14 days. Subsequently, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to assess the effect of CKF on neuropeptides substance P (SP) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), as well as inflammatory cytokines in serum and in intestinal tissues. Further, colonic pathological changes, the amount of colonic mast cells, and the expression level of occludin in rat colon tissues, were investigated by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, toluidine blue staining, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. To explore the underlying mechanisms, alterations in colonic RNA transcriptomics for the normal, model, and CKF treatment groups were assessed using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Subsequently, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot (WB), and immunofluorescence (IF) assays were applied to validate the effect of CKF on predicted pathways in vivo and in vitro. In addition, to elucidate the potential active compounds in CKF, 11 representative components found in CKF were selected, and their anti-inflammation potentials were evaluated using LPS-treated RAW264.7\u00a0cell models. CKF treatment significantly reduced the number of fecal pellets, attenuated visceral hypersensitivity, and decreased 5-HT and SP concentrations in serum and colon tissues, along with a reduction in colonic mast cell counts, correlating with improved symptoms in IBS-D rats. Meanwhile, CKF treatment reduced the colonic inflammatory cell infiltration, lowered the levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 in serum and colon tissues, and increased the occludin protein expression in colon tissues to improve inflammatory response and colonic barrier function. RNA-Seq, in conjugation with our previous network pharmacology analysis, indicated that CKF might mitigate the symptoms of IBS-D rats by inhibiting the Toll like receptor 4/Nuclear factor kappa-B/NLR family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (TLR4/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3) pathway, which was confirmed by WB, IF, and qRT-PCR experiments in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, coptisine, berberine, hyperoside, epicatechin, and gallic acid present in CKF emerged as potential active components for treating IBS-D, as they demonstrated in vitro anti-inflammatory effects. Our findings demonstrate that CKF effectively improves the symptoms of IBS-D rats, potentially through the inhibition of the TLR4/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 pathway. Moreover, this study unveils the potential bioactive components in CKF that could be applied in the treatment of IBS-D.",

        "Abstract": "Visceral hypersensitivity resulting from compromised gut barrier with activated immune system is a key feature of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activate proinflammatory cytokine signaling to induce these changes, which is one of the mechanisms of IBS. As activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or TLR4 leads to release interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, the NLRP3 inflammasome may be involved in the pathophysiology of IBS. Tranilast, an anti-allergic drug has been demonstrated to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, and we evaluated the impact of tranilast on visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability induced by LPS or CRF (IBS rat model). Visceral pain threshold caused by colonic balloon distention was measured by monitoring abdominal muscle contractions electrophysiologically. Colonic permeability was determined by quantifying the absorbed Evans blue within the colonic tissue. Colonic protein levels of NLRP3 and IL-1\u03b2 were assessed by immunoblot or ELISA. Intragastric administration of tranilast (20-200\u00a0mg/kg) for 3\u00a0days inhibited LPS (1\u00a0mg/kg)-induced visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneously, tranilast also abolished these alterations induced by CRF (50\u00a0\u00b5g/kg). LPS increased colonic protein levels of NLRP3 and IL-1\u03b2, and tranilast inhibited these changes. \u03b2-hydroxy butyrate, an NLRP3 inhibitor, also abolished visceral hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability caused by LPS. In contrast, IL-1\u03b2 induced similar GI alterations to LPS, which were not modified by tranilast. In conclusion, tranilast improved visceral pain and colonic barrier by suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome in IBS rat models. Tranilast may be useful for IBS treating.",

        "Abstract": "To evaluate the therapeutic effect of SYNC in diarrhea irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) and explore its underlying mechanism through transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-Seq). A rat model of IBS-D was constructed to elucidate the effects of SYNC. Abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR), fecal water content (FWC), and recording body weight were calculated to assess visceral sensitivity in rats. Histopathological changes in the colon and alterations in mast cell (MC) count were determined. Immunohistochemistry was employed to assess mast cell tryptase (MCT) expression in rat colons. Serum levels of corticotropin-releasing Hormone (CRH), interleukin-6 (IL-6), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were quantified using ELISA. RNA-Seq of colon tissue was performed, followed by Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. Western blot analysis was conducted to quantify the expression levels of key proteins in the Nr4a3 pathway in the colon and hypothalamus tissues of rats. SYNC alleviated visceral hypersensitivity and mood disorders in rats with IBS-D. Moreover, it was positively correlated with its dosage and the observed effects, such as the enhancement of the colon's mucosal lining condition and reduction in the number and activation of MCs within the model group. SYNC reduced the expression levels of factors related to the brain-gut axis and inflammatory markers in the bloodstream. RNA-Seq analysis indicated that SYNC down-regulated the expression of Nr4a3 and PI3K. These SYNC-targeted genes primarily played roles in immune regulation and inflammatory responses, correlating with the modulation of Nr4a3 and the PI3K/AKT pathway. Western blot analysis further confirmed SYNC's influence on inflammation-related MC activation by downregulating key proteins in the Nr4a3/PI3K pathway. SYNC inhibited mast cell activation and attenuated visceral hypersensitivity in the colon tissues of IBS-D rats. These effects were mediated by the Nr4a3/PI3K signaling pathway.",

The gut incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which has been proposed as a new treatment for T2DM, are extensively metabolized by Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4). Inhibitors of DPP-4 block the degradation of GLP-1 and GIP and may increase their natural circulating levels, favoring glycemic control in T2DM. A novel and potent selective inhibitor of DPP-4 with an 8-purine derived structure (<b>1</b>) has been developed and tested in vitro and in vivo in Z\u00fccker obese diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, an experimental model of the metabolic syndrome and T2DM to assess the inhibitory activity using vildagliptin as reference standard.

        "Abstract": "Intestinal barrier dysfunction, leaky gut, is implicated in various diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease. Our recent investigation revealed that basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), critical for cognitive function, receive signals from butyrate and orexin, playing a role in regulating intestinal barrier function through adenosine A2B signaling and the vagus. This study explores the involvement and function of brain histamine, linked to BFCNs, in the regulation of intestinal barrier function. Colonic permeability, assessed by quantifying absorbed Evans blue in rat colonic tissue, showed that histamine did not affect increased colonic permeability induced by LPS when administered subcutaneously. However, intracisternal histamine administration improved colonic hyperpermeability. Elevating endogenous histamine levels in the brain with SKF91488, a histamine N-methyltransferase inhibitor, also improved colonic hyperpermeability. This effect was abolished by intracisternal chlorpheniramine, an histamine H1 receptor antagonist, not ranitidine, an H2 receptor antagonist. The SKF91488-induced improvement in colonic hyperpermeability was blocked by vagotomy, intracisternal pirenzepine (suppressing BFCNs activity), or alloxazine (an adenosine A2B receptor antagonist). Additionally, intracisternal chlorpheniramine injection eliminated butyrate-induced improvement in colonic hyperpermeability. These findings suggest that brain histamine, acting via the histamine H1 receptor, regulates intestinal barrier function involving BFCNs, adenosine A2B signaling, and the vagus. Brain histamine appears to centrally regulate intestinal barrier function influenced by butyrate, differentiating its actions from peripheral histamine in conditions like IBS, where mast cell-derived histamine induces leaky gut. Brain histamine emerges as a potential pharmacological target for diseases associated with leaky gut, such as dementia and IBS.",

        "Abstract": "The common disorders irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can modify the drugs' pharmacokinetics via their induced pathophysiological changes. This work aimed to investigate the impact of these two diseases on pravastatin oral bioavailability. Rat models for IBS and IBD were used to experimentally test the effects of IBS and IBD on pravastatin pharmacokinetics. Then, the observations made in rats were extrapolated to humans using a mechanistic whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (wbPBPK) model. The rat in vivo studies done herein showed that IBS and IBD decreased serum albumin (> 11% for both), decreased PRV binding in plasma, and increased pravastatin absolute oral bioavailability (0.17 and 0.53 compared to 0.01) which increased plasma, muscle, and liver exposure. However, the wbPBPK model predicted muscle concentration was much lower than the pravastatin toxicity thresholds for myotoxicity and rhabdomyolysis. Overall, IBS and IBD can significantly increase pravastatin oral bioavailability which can be due to a combination of increased pravastatin intestinal permeability and decreased pravastatin gastric degradation resulting in higher exposure. This is the first study in the literature investigating the effects of IBS and IBD on pravastatin pharmacokinetics. The high interpatient variability in pravastatin concentrations as induced by IBD and IBS can be reduced by oral administration of pravastatin using enteric-coated tablets. Such disease (IBS and IBD)-drug interaction can have more drastic consequences for narrow therapeutic index drugs prone to gastric degradation, especially for drugs with low intestinal permeability.",

        "Abstract": "Serotonin receptor 2B (5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor) plays a critical role in many chronic pain conditions. The possible involvement of the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor in the altered gut sensation of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) was investigated in the present study. To investigate the possible involvement of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor in the altered gut sensation in rat model and patients with IBS-D. Rectosigmoid biopsies were collected from 18 patients with IBS-D and 10 patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation who fulfilled the Rome IV criteria and 15 healthy controls. The expression level of the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor in colon tissue was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and correlated with abdominal pain scores. The IBS-D rat model was induced by intracolonic instillation of acetic acid and wrap restraint. Alterations in visceral sensitivity and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor and transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) expression were examined following 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor antagonist administration. Changes in visceral sensitivity after administration of the TRPV1 antagonist were recorded. Here, we observed greater expression of the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor in the colonic mucosa of patients with IBS-D than in that of controls, which was correlated with abdominal pain scores. Intracolonic instillation of acetic acid and wrap restraint induced obvious chronic visceral hypersensitivity and increased fecal weight and fecal water content. Exogenous 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor agonist administration increased visceral hypersensitivity, which was alleviated by successive administration of a TRPV1 antagonist. IBS-D rats receiving the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor antagonist exhibited inhibited visceral hyperalgesia.Moreover, the percentage of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor-immunoreactive (IR) cells surrounded by TRPV1-positive cells (5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor I<sup>+</sup>) and total 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor IR cells (5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor I<sub>T</sub>) in IBS-D rats was significantly reduced by the administration of a 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor antagonist. Our finding that increased expression of the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor contributes to visceral hyperalgesia by inducing TRPV1 expression in IBS-D patients provides important insights into the potential mechanisms underlying IBS-D-associated visceral hyperalgesia.",

        "Abstract": "The pathogenesis of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is related to damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier function. Based on the Mast cell (MC)/Tryptase/Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2)/Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) pathway, this study explored the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on IBS-D rats and its possible mechanism of protecting the intestinal mucosal barrier. The IBS-D rat model was established by mother-offspring separation, acetic acid enema, and chronic restraint stress. The efficacy of EA on IBS-D rats was evaluated by observing the rate of loose stool (LSP) and the minimum volume threshold of abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) in rats. Mast cells and the ultrastructure of intestinal mucosa were observed by H&E staining, toluidine blue staining, and transmission electron microscopy. The expression levels of Tryptase, PAR-2, MLCK, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and Occludin in rats were detected by ELISA, qRT-PCR, and western blot. After 7 days of intervention, compared to the IBS-D group, the loose stool rates of rats in IBS-D + EA group and IBS-D + ketotifen group were decreased (<i>P</i> < 0.01), the minimum volume thresholds of AWR were improved (<i>P</i> < 0.01), the inflammation of colon tissue decreased, the number of MCs were decreased (<i>P</i> < 0.01), the expression of Tryptase, PAR-2, and MLCK were lowered (<i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.05), and the expression of ZO-1 and Occludin were enhanced (<i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.05). Compared to the EA group, there was no significant difference in each index between the ketotifen groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05). EA has a good therapeutic effect on IBS-D rats. Regulating the MCs/Tryptase/PAR-2/MLCK pathway may be a mechanism to protect the intestinal mucosal barrier.",

        "Abstract": "Increased levels of lactate, an end-product of glycolysis, have been proposed as a potential surrogate marker for metabolic changes during neuronal excitation. These changes in lactate levels can result in decreased brain pH, which has been implicated in patients with various neuropsychiatric disorders. We previously demonstrated that such alterations are commonly observed in five mouse models of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism, suggesting a shared endophenotype among these disorders rather than mere artifacts due to medications or agonal state. However, there is still limited research on this phenomenon in animal models, leaving its generality across other disease animal models uncertain. Moreover, the association between changes in brain lactate levels and specific behavioral abnormalities remains unclear. To address these gaps, the International Brain pH Project Consortium investigated brain pH and lactate levels in 109 strains/conditions of 2294 animals with genetic and other experimental manipulations relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders. Systematic analysis revealed that decreased brain pH and increased lactate levels were common features observed in multiple models of depression, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and some additional schizophrenia models. While certain autism models also exhibited decreased pH and increased lactate levels, others showed the opposite pattern, potentially reflecting subpopulations within the autism spectrum. Furthermore, utilizing large-scale behavioral test battery, a multivariate cross-validated prediction analysis demonstrated that poor working memory performance was predominantly associated with increased brain lactate levels. Importantly, this association was confirmed in an independent cohort of animal models. Collectively, these findings suggest that altered brain pH and lactate levels, which could be attributed to dysregulated excitation/inhibition balance, may serve as transdiagnostic endophenotypes of debilitating neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by cognitive impairment, irrespective of their beneficial or detrimental nature.",

        "Title": "Paeoniflorin Alleviates Anxiety and Visceral Hypersensitivity via HPA Axis and BDNF/TrkB/PLC\u03b31 Pathway in Maternal Separation-induced IBS-like Rats.",
        "Abstract": "Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder that significantly diminishes the quality of life for affected individuals. The pathophysiology of IBS remains poorly understood, and available therapeutic options for IBS are limited. The crucial roles of brain-gut interaction, which is mediated by the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenocortical (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system in IBS, have attracted increasing attention. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of paeoniflorin (PF) on anxiety and visceral hypersensitivity in maternal separation-induced IBS-like rats. The IBS-like rat model was established through the implementation of Maternal Separation (MS) and subsequently subjected to various doses of PF administered via oral gavage for 14 days. Anxiety-like behavior was evaluated using the Open Field Test (OFT) and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) test. The assessment of visceral sensitivity involved the utilization of the Abdominal Withdrawal Reflex (AWR) score and electromyographic (EMG) responses of the external oblique muscle in response to colorectal distention. The levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone (CORT), and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) were examined by ELISA. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence were employed to detect the expressions of CRH receptors 1 (CRHR1) and 2 (CRHR2). Glucocorticoid receptors (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB), and phospholipase C \u03b31 (PLC\u03b31) were examined by Western blot. The results showed that MS induced anxiety-like behavior and visceral hypersensitivity, while PF treatment attenuated these changes. Furthermore, the HPA axis hyperactivity in MS rats was attenuated by PF treatment, indicated by reduced serum ACTH, CORT, and CRH levels and recovered hippocampal CRHR1 and GR expressions. In addition, PF inhibited BDNF/TrkB signaling by downregulating the protein levels of BDNF, TrkB, and phospho-PLC\u03b31 in the colon. These findings suggest that PF alleviated anxiety and visceral hypersensitivity in MS-induced IBS-like rats, which may be the modulation of HPA axis activity and BDNF/TrkB/PLC\u03b31 signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "To observe the effects of moxibustion on colonic mast cell degranulation and inflammatory factor expression in rats with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), and explore the potential mechanism of moxibustion in treating IBS-D. Forty-five rat pups born from 5 healthy SPF-grade pregnant SD rats, with 8 rats were randomly selected as the normal group. The remaining 37 rats were intervened with maternal separation, acetic acid enema, and chronic restraint stress to establish the IBS-D model. The successfully modeled 32 rats were then randomly assigned to a model group, a ketotifen group, a moxibustion group, and a moxibustion-medication group, with 8 rats in each group. The rats in the ketotifen group were intervened with intragastric administration of ketotifen solution (10 mL/kg); the rats in the moxibustion group were intervened with suspended moxibustion on bilateral \"Tianshu\" (ST 25) and \"Shangjuxu\" (ST 37); the rats in the moxibustion-medication group were intervened with suspended moxibustion combined with intragastric administration of ketotifen solution. All interventions were administered once daily for 7 consecutive days. The diarrhea rate and minimum volume threshold of abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) were calculated before and after modeling, as well as after intervention. After intervention, colonic tissue morphology was observed using HE staining; colonic mucosal ultrastructure was examined by scanning electron microscopy; colonic mast cell ultrastructure was observed using transmission electron microscopy; mast cell degranulation was assessed by toluidine blue staining; serum and colonic levels of histamine, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, trypsin-like enzyme, and protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) were measured by ELISA; the Western blot and real-time quantitative PCR were employed to evaluate the protein and mRNA expression of colonic IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, trypsin-like enzyme, and PAR-2; the immunofluorescence was used to detect the positive expression of histamine, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, trypsin-like enzyme, and PAR-2 in the colonic tissue. Compared to the normal group, the rats in the model group exhibited extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells in colonic tissue, severe damage to the colonic mucosa, disordered arrangement of villi, reduced electron density, and a significant decrease in granule quantity within mast cells. The diarrhea rate and mast cell degranulation rate were increased (<i>P</i><0.01), AWR minimum volume threshold was decreased (<i>P</i><0.01); the serum and colonic levels of histamine, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, trypsin-like enzyme, and PAR-2 were elevated (<i>P</i><0.01); the positive expression of histamine, as well as protein, mRNA and positive expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, trypsin-like enzyme, and PAR-2 in the colon were all elevated (<i>P</i><0.01). Compared to the model group, the rats in the ketotifen group, the moxibustion group, and the moxibustion-medication group exhibited significantly reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells in colonic tissue, relatively intact colonic mucosa, orderly arranged villi, increased electron density, and an augmented number of mast cell granules; the diarrhea rate and mast cell degranulation rate were decreased (<i>P</i><0.01), and AWR minimum volume threshold was increased (<i>P</i><0.01); the serum and colonic levels of histamine, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, trypsin-like enzyme, and PAR-2 were reduced (<i>P</i><0.01); the positive expression of histamine, as well as protein, mRNA and positive expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, trypsin-like enzyme, and PAR-2 in the colon were all decreased (<i>P</i><0.01). Compared to the ketotifen group, the moxibustion group showed decreased serum levels of histamine, IL-6, and trypsin-like enzyme (<i>P</i><0.01, <i>P</i><0.05), as well as reduced colonic levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 (<i>P</i><0.01, <i>P</i><0.05); the protein expression of colonic IL-1\u03b2, IL-1\u03b1, and PAR-2 was reduced (<i>P</i><0.05), and the positive expression of colonic IL-1\u03b2 and trypsin-like enzyme was reduced (<i>P</i><0.01, <i>P</i><0.05). Compared to both the ketotifen group and the moxibustion group, the moxibustion-medication group exhibited decreased diarrhea rate and mast cell degranulation rate (<i>P</i><0.01), an increased AWR minimum volume threshold (<i>P</i><0.01), reduced serum and colonic levels of histamine, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, trypsin-like enzyme, and PAR-2 (<i>P</i><0.01), decreased protein expression of colonic IL-1\u03b2, trypsin-like enzyme, and PAR-2 (<i>P</i><0.01, <i>P</i><0.05), reduced mRNA and positive expression of colonic IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, trypsin-like enzyme, and PAR-2 (<i>P</i><0.01, <i>P</i><0.05), and decreased positive expression of colonic histamine (<i>P</i><0.01). Moxibustion on \"Tianshu\" (ST 25) and \"Shangjuxu\" (ST 37) might inhibit low-grade inflammatory reactions in the colon of IBS-D model rats. The mechanism may be related to the inhibition of histamine and trypsin-like enzyme secreted by mast cell, thereby reducing the expression of related inflammatory factors.",

        "Abstract": "Melatonin acute treatment limits obesity of young Z\u00fccker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats by non-shivering thermogenesis (NST). We recently showed melatonin chronically increases the oxidative status of vastus lateralis (VL) in both obese and lean adult male animals. The identification of VL skeletal muscle-based NST by uncoupling of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA)- sarcolipin (SLN) prompted us to investigate whether melatonin is a SERCA-SLN calcium futile cycle uncoupling and mitochondrial biogenesis enhancer. Obese ZDF rats and lean littermates (ZL) of both sexes were subdivided into two subgroups: control (C) and 12 weeks orally melatonin treated (M) (10\u202fmg/kg/day). Compared to the control groups, melatonin decreased the body weight gain and visceral fat in ZDF rats of both sexes. Melatonin treatment in both sex obese rats restored the VL muscle skin temperature and sensitized the thermogenic effect of acute cold exposure. Moreover, melatonin not only raised SLN protein levels in the VL of obese and lean rats of both sexes; also, the SERCA activity. Melatonin treatment increased the SERCA2 expression in obese and lean rats (both sexes), with no effects on SERCA1 expression. Melatonin increased the expression of thermogenic genes and proteins (PGC1-\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, and NRF1). Furthermore, melatonin treatment enhanced the expression ratio of P-CaMKII/CaMKII and P-AMPK/AMPK. In addition, it rose mitochondrial biogenesis. These results provided the initial evidence that chronic oral melatonin treatment triggers the CaMKII/AMPK/PGC1\u03b1 axis by upregulating SERCA2-SLN-mediated NST in ZDF diabetic rats of both sexes. This may further contribute to the body weight control and metabolic benefits of melatonin.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic visceral hypersensitivity is closely associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a very common disorder which significantly impairs quality of life, characterized by abdominal pain, and distension. Imaging studies have found that IBS patients show higher metabolic activities and functional differences from normal controls in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), in response to visceral pain stimulation. Non-clinical data and clinical data suggest that medicinal products containing essential oils such as peppermint or caraway oil exert beneficial effects on IBS symptoms. We assessed acute and long-term treatment effects of a mixture of peppermint and caraway essential oils (Menthacarin) on brain electrophysiological markers of gut pain sensitivity in two rat models of visceral hypersensitivity. Chronic administration of corticosteroids and acute repeated mechanical hyperstimulation under anesthesia induced hyperalgesia and hypersensitivity, characterized by an increase in electrophysiological excitatory responses of ACC neurons to colorectal distension (CRD) and an increase in the proportion of neurons responding to otherwise subthreshold stimulation, respectively. Long-term, but not acute, oral administration of Menthacarin (60\u2009mg kg<sup>-1</sup>\u2009day<sup>-1</sup>) significantly reduced the net excitatory response to CRD in normally responsive control animals and counteracted the development of visceral hyperalgesia and hypersensitivity induced by repeated corticosterone administration and acute mechanical stimulation. The present study shows that, using the CRD method, chronic Menthacarin administration at a clinically relevant dose attenuates the neuronal discharge associated with visceral pain stimuli in the rat ACC, particularly in models of hypersensitivity, suggesting a potential for treating exaggerated visceral pain sensitivity.",

        "Abstract": "Imbalanced gut microbiota (GM) and abnormal fecal bile acid (BA) are thought to be the key factors for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we explore the influence of the GM-BA-Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) axis on IBS-D. Twenty-five IBS-D patients and fifteen healthy controls were recruited to perform BA-related metabolic and metagenomic analyses. Further, the microbiota-humanized IBS-D rat model was established by fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) to investigate the GM-BA-TGR5 axis effects on the colonic barrier and visceral hypersensitivity (VH) in IBS-D. Finally, we used chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), an important BA screened out by metabolome, to evaluate whether it affected diarrhea and VH via the TGR5 pathway. Clinical research showed that GM associated with bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity such as <i>Bacteroides ovatus</i> was markedly reduced in the GM of IBS-D, accompanied by elevated total and primary BA levels. Moreover, we found that CDCA not only was increased as the most important primary BA in IBS-D patients but also could induce VH through upregulating TGR5 in the colon and ileum of normal rats. TGR5 inhibitor could reverse the phenotype, depression-like behaviors, pathological change, and level of fecal BSH in a microbiota-humanized IBS-D rat model. Our findings proved that human-associated FMT could successfully induce the IBS-D rat model, and the imbalanced GM-BA-TGR5 axis may promote colonic mucosal barrier dysfunction and enhance VH in IBS-D. Visceral hypersensitivity and intestinal mucosal barrier damage are important factors that cause abnormal brain-gut interaction in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Recently, it was found that the imbalance of the gut microbiota-bile acid axis is closely related to them. Therefore, understanding the structure and function of the gut microbiota and bile acids and the underlying mechanisms by which they shape visceral hypersensitivity and mucosal barrier damage in IBS-D is critical. An examination of intestinal feces from IBS-D patients revealed that alterations in gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism underlie IBS-D and symptom onset. We also expanded beyond existing knowledge of well-studied gut microbiota and bile acid and found that <i>Bacteroides ovatus</i> and chenodeoxycholic acid may be potential bacteria and bile acid involved in the pathogenesis of IBS-D. Moreover, our data integration reveals the influence of the microbiota-bile acid-TGR5 axis on barrier function and visceral hypersensitivity.",

Tenapanor is FDA-approved for the treatment of IBS with constipation (IBS-C) and has demonstrated improvements in bowel motility and a reduction in IBS-related pain; however, the mechanism by which tenapanor mediates these functions remains unclear. Here, the effects of tenapanor on colonic pain signaling and intestinal permeability were assessed through behavioral, electrophysiological, and cell culture experiments. Intestinal motility studies in rats and humans demonstrated that tenapanor increased luminal sodium and water retention and gastrointestinal transit versus placebo. A significantly reduced visceral motor reflex (VMR) to colonic distension was observed with tenapanor treatment versus vehicle in two rat models of visceral hypersensitivity (neonatal acetic acid sensitization and partial restraint stress; both <i>P</i> < 0.05), returning VMR responses to that of nonsensitized controls. Whole cell voltage patch-clamp recordings of retrogradely labeled colonic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons from sensitized rats found that tenapanor significantly reduced DRG neuron hyperexcitability to capsaicin versus vehicle (<i>P</i> < 0.05), an effect not mediated by epithelial cell secretions. Tenapanor also attenuated increases in intestinal permeability in human colon monolayer cultures caused by incubation with proinflammatory cytokines (<i>P</i> < 0.001) or fecal supernatants from patients with IBS-C (<i>P</i> < 0.005). These results support a model in which tenapanor reduces IBS-related pain by strengthening the intestinal barrier, thereby decreasing permeability to macromolecules and antigens and reducing DRG-mediated pain signaling.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> A series of nonclinical experiments support the theory that tenapanor inhibits IBS-C-related pain by strengthening the intestinal barrier. Tenapanor treatment reduced visceral motor responses to nonsensitized levels in two rat models of hypersensitivity and reduced responses to capsaicin in sensitized colonic nociceptive dorsal root ganglia neurons. Intestinal permeability experiments in human colon monolayer cultures found that tenapanor attenuates increases in permeability induced by either inflammatory cytokines or fecal supernatants from patients with IBS-C.",

        "Abstract": "Constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) is a functional bowel disease that affects 10-20% of the population worldwide. Curcumin (CUR) is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat IBS, but its mechanism of action needs further investigation. In this study, we used mosapride (MOS) as a positive control to evaluate the changes in gut microbiota in IBS-C rat models after treatment with CUR or MOS by analyzing 16S rDNA variation. In addition, we used enzyme immunoassay kits and immunohistochemical analysis to investigate whether CUR or MOS influenced serotonin (5-HT), substance P (SP), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) levels in the serum and colon of IBS-C rats. The study showed that rats supplemented with CUR showed significantly increased fecal weight, fecal water content, small intestine transit rate and significantly decreased serum levels of 5-HT, VIP and SP compared to the IBS group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In addition, treatment with CUR changed the relative abundance of <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Sutterella</i>, <i>Acetanaerobacterium</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i>2 in the gut microbiota. This study showed that the efficacy of CUR on IBS-C was possibly by modulating the microbiota and lowering the serum levels of HT, SP, and VIP.",

        "Abstract": "Treatment strategies for constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) continue to improve. However, effective drugs are still lacking. Herein, we explored whether sodium hyaluronate (SH) could be used to treat IBS-C. The effects of SH with different molecular weights were compared in a rat model of IBS-C. Low-molecular-weight SH (LMW-SH, 5\u00a0\u223c\u00a010\u00a0kDa), medium-molecular-weight SH (MMW-SH, 200\u00a0\u223c\u00a0400\u00a0kDa), and high-molecular-weight SH (HMW-SH, 1300\u00a0\u223c\u00a01500\u00a0kDa) were screened for efficacy in IBS-C using the following indicators: body weight, number of fecal pellets, fecal moisture, visceral hypersensitivity, and gastrointestinal transit rate. H-HMW-SH was the most effective in improving IBS-C symptoms. The ELISA kits indicated that H-HMW-SH reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, and TNF-\u03b1 in IBS-C rats. In addition, both western blot and immunofluorescence analyses showed that H-HMW-SH increased the protein expressions of claudin-1, occludin and zonula occludens-1. Furthermore, H-HMW-SH restored the balance of intestinal flora in different intestinal contents (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon) and feces of rats with IBS-C. Overall, our study illustrates the therapeutic potential of H-HMW-SH in the treatment of IBS-C.",

        "Abstract": "This study aims to investigate the mechanism of Linderae Radix water extract(LRWE) in the prevention and treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome(IBS-D) based on serum metabolomics. Eighteen 2-week-old male SD rats were randomized into control, IBS-D model, and LRWE groups. The rats in other groups except the control group received gavage of senna concentrate combined with restraint stress for the modeling of IBS-D. The rats in the LRWE group were administrated with LRWE(5.4 g\u00b7kg~(-1)) by gavage, and those in the control and IBS-D model groups with an equal volume of distilled water for a total of 14 days. The visceral sensitivity was evaluated by the abdominal withdrawal reflex(AWR) score, and the degree of diarrhea was assessed by the fecal water content(FWC). The morphological changes of the colon and the morphology and number of goblet cells were observed by hematoxylin-eosin(HE) and periodic acid-schiff(PAS) staining, respectively. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry(UPLC-MS/MS) was used for the screening of the potential biomarkers in the rat serum and their related metabolic pathways. The results showed that LRWE reduced the AWR score, decreased FWC, and alleviated visceral sensitivity and diarrhea symptoms in IBS-D rats. HE and PAS staining showed that LRWE mitigated low-grade intestinal inflammation and increased the number of mature secretory goblet cells in the colonic epithelium of IBS-D rats. A total of 25 potential biomarkers of LRWE in treating IBS-D were screened out in this study, which were mainly involved in riboflavin, tryptophan, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and cysteine and methionine metabolism. The regulatory effects were the most significant on the riboflavin and tryptophan metabolism pathways. LRWE may alleviate the visceral hypersensitivity by promoting energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism, enhancing intestinal barrier function, and improving intestinal immune function in IBS-D rats.",

        "Abstract": "Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), associated with increased intestinal permeability, inflammation, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, can be triggered by acute gastroenteritis. Cytolethal distending toxin B (CdtB) is produced by gastroenteritis-causing pathogens and may underlie IBS-D development, through molecular mimicry with vinculin. Here, we examine the effects of exposure to CdtB alone on gut microbiome composition, host intestinal gene expression, and IBS-D-like phenotypes in a rat model. CdtB-inoculated rats exhibited increased anti-CdtB levels, which correlated with increased stool wet weights, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL2) and predicted microbial metabolic pathways including inflammatory responses, TNF responses, and diarrhea. Three distinct ileal microbiome profiles (microtypes) were identified in CdtB-inoculated rats. The first microtype (most like controls) had altered relative abundance (RA) of genera <i>Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus,</i> and <i>Rothia</i>. The second had lower microbial diversity, higher <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i> RA, higher absolute <i>E. coli</i> abundance, and altered host ileal tissue expression of immune-response and TNF-response genes compared to controls. The third microtype had higher microbial diversity, higher RA of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S)-producer <i>Desulfovibrio</i>, and increased expression of H<sub>2</sub>S-associated pain/serotonin response genes. All CdtB-inoculated rats exhibited decreased ileal expression of cell junction component mRNAs, including vinculin-associated proteins. Significantly, cluster-specific microRNA-mRNA interactions controlling intestinal permeability, visceral hypersensitivity/pain, and gastrointestinal motility genes, including several previously associated with IBS were seen. These findings demonstrate that exposure to CdtB toxin alone results in IBS-like phenotypes including inflammation and diarrhea-like stool, decreased expression of intestinal barrier components, and altered ileal microtypes that influenced changes in microRNA-modulated gene expression and predicted metabolic pathways consistent with specific IBS-D symptoms.",

        "Title": "The genetics of neuroticism: Insights from the Maudsley rat model and human studies.",
        "Abstract": "We examine some of the genetic features of neuroticism (N) taking as an animal model the Maudsley Reactive (MR) and Maudsley Nonreactive (MNR) rat strains which were selectively bred, respectively, for high and low open-field defecation (OFD) starting in the late 1950s. To draw analogies with human genetic studies, we explore the genetic correlation of N with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We review progress with the rat model and developments in the field of human complex trait genetics, including genetic association studies that relate to current understanding of the genetics of N. The widespread differences in the tone of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system that have been found between the Maudsley strains, particularly those observed in the colon, may underly the differences in OFD (MNR, higher sympathetic tone and zero defecation). In humans, a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) reported six genes contributing to IBS, four of which were implicated in mood and anxiety disorders or were expressed in the brain, with three of the four also expressed in the nerve fibers and ganglia of the gut. Heritability of N is estimated at around 50% in twin and family studies, and GWASs identified hundreds of loci, enabling estimation of genome-wide correlations (r<sub>g</sub>) with other traits. Significantly, the estimate for r<sub>g</sub> between risk of IBS, anxiety, N, and depression was >0.5 and suggested genetic pleiotropy without evidence for causal mechanisms. Findings on the adrenergic pharmacology of the colon, coupled with new understanding of the role of the locus ceruleus in modifying afferent information from this organ, generate hypotheses that challenge traditional cause/effect notions about the relationship of the central nervous system to peripheral events in response to stress, suggest specific targets for gene action in the Maudsley model and emphasize the value of reciprocal evaluation of genetic architecture underlying N in rodents and humans.",

        "Abstract": "To explore the effect of acupuncture and moxibustion on intestinal flora in the rats with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) based on 16S rDNA technique. Ten rats were randomized from 58 SPF-grade male SD rats to be the blank group. The remained 48 rats were prepared to be IBS-D models by the modified method of acetic acid enema combined with binding tail-clip stress. Forty successfully-modeled rats were randomly divided into a model group, an acupuncture group, a moxibustion group and a western medication group, with 10 rats in each one. In the acupuncture group, the needle was inserted at bilateral \"Zusanli\" (ST 36) and remained for 15 min in each rat. In the moxibustion group, the suspending moxibustion was delivered at bilateral \"Zusanli\" (ST 36) for 15 min. The rats in the western medication group were given pinaverium bromide suspension (10 mL/kg) by intragastric administration. The above interventions were performed once daily for consecutive 14 days. The body mass and the score of fecal trait were compared before and after modeling, as well as after intervention in each group. Fecal water content, diarrhea index and colon transit time (CTT) were measured after modeling and intervention in the rats of each group separately. After intervention, the colonic morphology of rats in each group was observed, and using 16S rDNA technique, the intestinal flora was detected. After modeling, compared with the blank group, the body mass and CTT were reduced (<i>P</i><0.01); fecal trait scores, fecal water contents and diarrhea index increased (<i>P</i><0.01) in the other 4 groups. After intervention, the body mass and CTT of the rats decreased (<i>P</i><0.01), and fecal trait score, fecal water content and diarrhea index increased (<i>P</i><0.01) in the model group compared with those in the blank group. In the acupuncture group, the moxibustion group and the western medication group, when compared with the model group, the body mass and CTT were elevated (<i>P<</i>0.01), while fecal trait scores, fecal water contents and diarrhea index declined (<i>P</i><0.01). Compared with the western medication group, fecal water content decreased in the acupuncture group and the moxibustion group (<i>P<</i>0.05), while CTT increased in the acupuncture group (<i>P</i><0.01), the body mass increased and fecal trait score was dropped in the moxibustion group (<i>P</i><0.05). The colonic mucosa structure was clear and complete, and there was no obvious inflammatory cell infiltration in the blank group. The mild interstitial edema of intestinal mucosa was presented with the infiltration of few inflammatory cells in the model group. There was the infiltration of few inflammatory cells in the mucosa of the acupuncture group, the moxibustion group and the western medication group. Compared with the blank group, the indexes of Richness, Chao1, ACE and Shannon decreased in the model group (<i>P</i><0.05). Indexes of Richness, Chao1 and ACE increased in the acupuncture group and the moxibustion group (<i>P</i><0.05), and the Richness index in the western medication group increased (<i>P<</i>0.05) when compared with those in the model group. The relative abundance of <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Prevotella</i> increased (<i>P</i><0.05), and that of <i>Firmicutes</i> and <i>Muribaculaceae</i> decreased (<i>P</i><0.05) in the model group compared with those in the blank group.

The relative abundance of LPS biosynthesis was dropped (<i>P</i><0.05), and that of folate biosynthesis, lipoic acid metabolism, zeatin biosynthesis, ubiquinone and other terpenoid quinone biosynthesis increased (<i>P</i><0.05) in the acupuncture group, the moxibustion group and the western medication group compared with those of the model group. Either acupuncture or moxibustion can relieve the symptoms of IBS-D and protect intestinal mucosa, which may be associated with regulating the structure of intestinal flora and promoting nutrient metabolism and biosynthesis.",

        "Abstract": "High-density lipoprotein (HDL) therapy has demonstrated beneficial effects in acute stroke and acute myocardial infarction models by reducing infarct size. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of reconstituted HDL (rHDL) on neointimal hyperplasia and elucidated its underlying mechanism using a balloon injury rat model. Our finding revealed a significant 37% reduction in the intima to media ratio in the arteries treated with 80\u00a0mg/kg rHDL compared to those subjected to injury alone (p\u2009<\u20090.05), indicating a specific inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia. In vivo analysis further supported the positive effects of rHDL by demonstrating a reduction in smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and an increase in endothelial cell (EC) proliferation. Additionally, rHDL treatment led to decreased infiltration of leukocytes and downregulated the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) in the neointimal area. Notably, rHDL administration resulted in decreased expression of VCAM1 and HIF1\u03b1, alongside increased expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). Overexpression of HSP27 and HO1 effectively inhibited SMC proliferation. Moreover, rHDL-mediated suppression of injury-induced HIF1\u03b1 coincided with upregulation of HSP27. Interestingly, HSP27 and HO1 had varying effects on the expression of chemokine receptors and rHDL did not exert significant effect on chemokine receptor expression in THP1 cells. These findings underscore the distinct roles of HSP27 and HO1 as potential regulatory factors in the progression of restenosis. Collectively, our study demonstrates that rHDL exerts a potent anti-neointimal hyperplasia effect by reducing leukocytes infiltration and SMC proliferation while promoting EC proliferation.",

An IBS-C model was established in rats by administration of ice water by gavage for 14 days. Fenchone increased the reduced body weight, number of fecal pellets, fecal moisture, and intestinal transit rate, and decreased the enhanced visceral hypersensitivity in the rat model of IBS-C. In addition, fenchone increased the serum content of excitatory neurotransmitters and decreased the serum content of inhibitory neurotransmitters in the IBS-C rat model. Meanwhile, western blot and immunofluorescence experiments indicated that fenchone increased the expressions of SCF and c-Kit. Furthermore, compared with the IBS-C model group, fenchone increased the relative abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Allobaculum</i>, <i>Subdoligranulum</i>, and <i>Ruminococcaceae_UCG-008</i>, and reduced the relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Enterococcus</i>, <i>Alistipes</i>, and <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i> on the genus level.

        "Abstract": "We recently demonstrated that diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) subjects have higher relative abundance (RA) of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S)-producing Fusobacterium and Desulfovibrio species, and constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) subjects have higher RA of methanogen Methanobrevibacter smithii. In this study, we investigate the effects of increased methanogens or H<sub>2</sub>S producers on stool phenotypes in rat models. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were fed high-fat diet (HFD) for 60\u00a0days to increase M. smithii levels, then gavaged for 10\u00a0days with water (controls) or methanogenesis inhibitors. To increase H<sub>2</sub>S producers, rats were gavaged with F. varium or D. piger. Stool consistency (stool wet weight (SWW)) and gas production were measured. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on stool samples. In HFD diet-fed rats (N\u2009=\u200930), stool M. smithii levels were\u00a0increased (P\u2009<\u20090.001) after 52\u00a0days, correlating with significantly decreased SWW (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) at 59\u00a0days (R\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.38, P\u2009=\u20090.037). Small bowel M.\u00a0smithii levels decreased significantly in lovastatin lactone-treated rats (P\u2009<\u20090.0006), and SWW increased (normalized) in lovastatin hydroxyacid-treated rats (P\u2009=\u20090.0246), vs. controls (N\u2009=\u200910/group). SWW increased significantly in D.\u00a0piger-gavaged rats (N\u2009=\u200916) on day 10 (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), and in F.\u00a0varium-gavaged rats (N\u2009=\u200916) at all timepoints, vs. controls, with increased stool H<sub>2</sub>S production. 16S sequencing revealed stool microbiota alterations in rats gavaged with H<sub>2</sub>S producers, with higher relative abundance (RA) of other H<sub>2</sub>S producers, particularly Lachnospiraceae and Bilophila in F.\u00a0varium-gavaged rats, and Sutterella in D.\u00a0piger-gavaged rats. These findings suggest that increased M. smithii levels result in a constipation-like phenotype in a rat model that is partly reversible with methanogenesis inhibitors, whereas gavage with H<sub>2</sub>S producers D.\u00a0piger or F.\u00a0varium results in increased colonization with other H<sub>2</sub>S producers and diarrhea-like phenotypes. This supports roles for the increased RA of methanogens and H<sub>2</sub>S producers identified in IBS-C and IBS-D subjects, respectively, in contributing to stool phenotypes.",

LUT reduces excessive intestinal motility and lowers reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in a water avoidance stress (WAS) rat model. Moreover, LUT increases the protein expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), activates the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and greatly reduces the hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> )-induced oxidative damage in intestinal epithelial cells.

        "Abstract": "Psychological stress is a major trigger for visceral hypersensitivity (VH) in irritable bowel syndrome. The zinc finger protein ZBTB20 (ZBTB20) is implicated in somatic nociception via modulating transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, but its role in the development of VH is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of ZBTB20/TRP channel axis in stress-induced VH. Rats were subjected to water avoidance stress (WAS) for 10 consecutive days. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting ZBTB20 was intrathecally administered. Inhibitors of TRP channels, stress hormone receptors, and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) were administered. Visceromotor response to colorectal distension was recorded. Dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) were dissected for Western blot, coimmunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. The DRG-derived neuron cell line was applied for specific research. WAS-induced VH was suppressed by the inhibitor of TRPV1, TRPA1, or TRPM8, with enhanced expression of these channels in L6-S2 DRGs. The inhibitor of glucocorticoid receptor or \u03b22-adrenergic receptor counteracted WAS-induced VH and TRP channel expression. Concurrently, WAS-induced stress hormone-dependent ZBTB20 expression and NF-\u03baB activation in DRGs. Intrathecally injected ZBTB20 siRNA or an NF-\u03baB inhibitor repressed WAS-caused effect. In cultured DRG-derived neurons, stress hormones promoted nuclear translocation of ZBTB20, which preceded p65 nuclear translocation. And, ZBTB20 siRNA suppressed stress hormone-caused NF-\u03baB activation. Finally, WAS enhanced p65 binding to the promoter of TRPV1, TRPA1, or TRPM8 in rat DRGs. ZBTB20 mediates stress-induced VH via activating NF-\u03baB/TRP channel pathway in nociceptive sensory neurons.",

        "Abstract": "To observe the effect of acupuncture on the expressions of neuropeptides and related inflammatory factors in rats with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome(IBS-D), so as to explore the mechanism of acupuncture in the treatment of IBS-D. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into blank group, model group, medication group, and acupuncture group, with 6 rats in each group. Except for the blank group, the other groups were subjected to 14-day \"acetic acid enema + restraint stress\" to establish the IBS-D rat model. After successful modeling, the medication group received gavage of pinaverium bromide(15 mg/kg) once a day, and the acupuncture group received acupuncture at \"Baihui\"(GV20) and bilateral \"Tianshu\"(ST25), \"Shangjuxu\"(ST37), \"Zusanli\"(ST36), and \"Taichong\"(LR3) for 20 min every day, both groups were treated continuously for 14 days. The general state of the rats in each group was observed, and the body weight of the rats was measured. The open-field experiment was conducted to measure the horizontal and vertical movements, and the number of fecal pellets of rats. The histopathological morphology of hypothalamus and colon of rats was observed by HE staining. Toluidine blue staining was used to observe and count the mast cells(MCs) in the colon tissue of rats. ELISA was used to detect the serum contents of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1(TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin(IL)-10. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was performed to detect the mRNA expressions of calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP) in the hypothalamus and colon tissue. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of corticotropin-releasing factor(CRF) in the hypothalamus and colon tissue. HE staining showed that there was inflammatory cell infiltration in the lamina propria of colon in the model group, and it was reduced in the other groups. Compared with the blank group, the model group showed significantly decreased body weight, decreased walking distance and upright times in open field experiment, decreased serum IL-10 contents(<i>P</i><0.05, <i>P</i><0.01), increased fecal pellet number (<i>P</i><0.01), increased MC number in the colon tissue, serum TNF-\u03b1 contents, and CGRP mRNA expressions and CRF expressions in the hypothalamus and colon tissue(<i>P</i><0.01). Compared with the model group, both medication and acupuncture groups showed significantly increased body weight, walking distance and upright times in the open-field experiment, and serum IL-10 contents(<i>P</i><0.01, <i>P</i><0.05), significantly decreased fecal pellet number (<i>P</i><0.05), significantly decreased MC number in the colon tissue, serum TNF-\u03b1 contents, and CGRP mRNA expressions in the hypothalamus and colon tissue(<i>P</i><0.01)\uff1bat the same time, the acupuncture group showed significantly decreased CRF expressions in the hypothalamus and colon tissue(<i>P</i><0.01, <i>P</i><0.05). There was no significant difference in the above indicators between the medication group and the acupuncture group. Acupuncture can improve the general and emotional state, inflammatory response, and neuropeptide expression in rats with IBS-D, and alleviate the symptoms of IBS-D, which may be related to the regulation of neuropeptides and inflammatory factors levels.",

        "Abstract": "To compare the effects of moxibustion and acupuncture of combined \"Biao-Ben\" acupoints (Biao indicates pathogenic factors of disease, Ben refers to body constitution) on a rat model of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). Forty female SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups\uff1anormal group, model group, moxibustion group, and acupuncture group, with 10 rats in each group. The IBS-D rat model was established by administering acute-chronic stress combined with folium sennae gavage for 28 days. Rats in the moxibustion group received moxibustion at bilateral \"Zusanli\"(ST36), \"Guanyuan\"(CV4), and \"Neiguan\"(PC6), while those in the acupuncture group received acupuncture at the same acupoints, both for 15 min every time, once a day. The treatments were administered for 21 days. The loose stool rate was observed. Colonic pain threshold and colonic distension threshold were measured by a self-made balloon catheter. Total distance traveled and grid crossing numbers were observed by open field test. Heart rate variability(HRV) time domain indexes SDANN and PNN50 were acguired by using electrophysiological recorder. Histopathological changes in the colon tissue were observed after HE staining. Contents of interleukin-6(IL-6), IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-\u03b1) in serum were detected by ELISA. Compared with the normal group, rats in the model group showed increased loose stool rate(<i>P</i><0.05), decreased pain threshold and distension threshold(<i>P</i><0.05), reduced total distance traveled and grid crossing numbers in the open field test(<i>P</i><0.05), decreased HRV time domain indexes SDANN and PNN50(<i>P</i><0.01, <i>P</i><0.05), and elevated levels of serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 contents(<i>P</i><0.05). Compared with the model group, the moxibustion group and acupuncture group showed decreased loose stool rate(<i>P</i><0.05), increased total distance traveled and grid crossing numbers in the open field test(<i>P</i><0.05), increased pain threshold and distension threshold(<i>P</i><0.05), increased SDANN and PNN50 (<i>P</i><0.05), and decreased levels of serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 contents(<i>P</i><0.05). Compared with the acupuncture group, the moxibustion group showed further decreased loose stool rate(<i>P</i><0.05), increased total distance traveled and grid crossing numbers in the open field test(<i>P</i><0.05), increased pain threshold and distension threshold(<i>P</i><0.05), increased SDANN and PNN50(<i>P</i><0.05), and decreased levels of serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 contents(<i>P</i><0.05). No significant pathological changes were observed in the colon tissue of rats in each group. Moxibustion of combined \"Biao-Ben\" acupoints is more effective in regulating HRV and serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 contents in the IBS-D rat model. Based on the combined \"Biao-Ben\" acupoints method, moxibustion has better therapeutic effects on IBS-D than acupuncture.",

This study aimed to evaluate colonic motility and serotonin system response to restraint stress (RS) among adolescent rats who underwent neonatal maternal separation (NMS) to clarify the features of pathogenesis in adolescents with IBS. Male rats were exposed to NMS as chronic stress, and a normally handled (NH) group was used as control. Four groups were created by adding RS as acute stress treatment to the NMS and NH groups. To realize the RS treatment, the subjects were restrained for 1 h at the age of 5 weeks, and hourly fecal pellet discharge was determined. After euthanization and proximal colon intestinal tissue collection, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 (5-HT3R) concentrations, enterochromaffin (EC) cell density, and the expression of mRNA-encoding slc6a4 were examined. The amount of fecal pellet discharge during RS increased significantly in the RS and NMS+RS groups compared with that in the NH and NMS groups, respectively. The 5-HT concentration in the intestinal tissue of rats in the RS and NMS groups increased significantly compared with that of rats in the NH group. EC cell density also increased significantly in the NMS and NMS+RS groups compared with that in the NH and RS groups. However, combined stress did not result in any significant differences in the expression of 5-HT3R and mRNA-encoding slc6a4. The combination of juvenile and acute stress effectively induced increased 5-HT concentration or EC cell density via the 5-HT pathway in the proximal colon of adolescent rats.",

IBS chronic visceral hyperalgesia model was established by colorectal dilation stimulation for 2 weeks for SD pups at 8 d after birth, which were fed until 8-week age after the stimulation. Then the verified successfully modeled adult rats were randomly divided into model, Shangjuxu, and non-acupoint groups, with 6 rats in each group, and 6 unmodeled rats were selected as normal group. On the next day of model evaluation, rats in the Shangjuxu group received acupuncture at right ST37 while rats in the non-acupoint group received acupuncture at the non-meridian and non-acupoint point in the right hypochondrium, both for 15 min, with manual twisting of mild reinforcing and reducing performed for 30 s at an interval of 5 min, once a day, for a total of 7 d. Abdominal withdrawal reflex(AWR) score was used to evaluate the degree of chronic visceral pain in rats. Western blot and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR were used to detect the colonic protein and mRNA expressions of NGF, tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), PI3K and TRPV1. The positive expressions of PI3K and TRPV1 proteins in the colon of rats were detected by immunohistochemistry method. Compared with the normal group, AWR scores corresponding to 4 pressure levels of 20, 40, 60 and 80 mm Hg, mRNA and protein expressions of NGF, TrkA, PI3K and TRPV1 in colon tissue, and positive expressions of PI3K and TRPV1 in colon tissue were significantly increased(<i>P</i><0.05) in the model group. After intervention, compared with the model group, rats in the Shangjuxu group had reduced AWR scores corresponding to 4 pressure levels of 20, 40, 60 and 80 mm Hg, lower colonic mRNA and protein expressions of NGF, TrkA, PI3K and TRPV1, and decreased positive expressions of PI3K and TRPV1 in colon tissue(<i>P</i><0.05), while there were no significant differences in the above indexes of the non-acupoint group. Manual acupuncture at ST37 can alleviate IBS chronic visceral hyperalgesia in rat and its analgesic effect may be related to regulating NGF/PI3K/TRPV1 signaling pathway.",

        "Title": "Neurobehavioral alterations induced by third-trimester gestation-equivalent ethanol exposure are inhibited by folate administration.",
        "Abstract": "Prenatal ethanol exposure (PEE) causes several neurobehavioral impairments in the fetus. Postnatal days (PDs) 4-9 in rodents are considered equivalent to the third trimester of gestation in humans. This period is characterized by high rates of synaptogenesis and myelination and the maturation of key structures and transmitter systems. Nutritional supplements, such as folate, have gained attention as putative treatments to mitigate detrimental effects of PEE. Folate is crucial for DNA synthesis and amino acid metabolism and heightens antioxidant defenses. The present study examined neurobehavioral effects of the concurrent administration of folate (20\u00a0mg/kg/day) and ethanol (5\u00a0g/kg/day) during PDs 4-9 in male and female Wistar rats. During PDs 16-18, the rat pups were tested for anxiety-like and exploratory activity in the light-dark box (LDB), open field (OF), and concentric square field (CSF) tests. After weaning, they were tested for sucrose preference and ethanol intake. Neonatal ethanol exposure reduced body weight in infancy but did not enhance ethanol self-administration or significantly affect performance in the OF or LDB. Neonatal ethanol exposure also reduced sucrose intake in the preference test and increased shelter-seeking in the CSF, and folate significantly inhibited these effects. The present findings suggest that folate, a treatment that is devoid of serious side effects, can ameliorate some neurobehavioral effects of PEE.",

We divided the subjects into three groups: one without stress exposure, another subjected to daily 1-hour WAS for 10 days, and a third exposed to the same WAS regimen while also receiving two different <i>R. faecis</i> strains (BBH024 or R22-12-24) via oral gavage for the same 10-day duration. Fecal pellet output (FPO), a toluidine blue assay for mast cell infiltration, and fecal microbiota analyses were conducted using 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing. Predictive functional profiling of microbial communities in metabolism was also conducted. FPO and colonic mucosal mast cell counts were significantly higher in the WAS group than in the control group (male, <i>P</i> = 0.004; female, <i>P</i> = 0.027).

Submucosal mast cell infiltration in the colon showed a similar pattern in males. In case of fecal microbiota, the WAS with <i>R. faecis</i> group showed increased abundance of the <i>Roseburia</i> genus compared to WAS alone. Moreover, the expression of a gene encoding a D-methionine transport system substrate-binding protein was significantly elevated in the WAS with <i>R. faecis</i> group compared to that in the WAS (male, <i>P</i> = 0.028; female, <i>P</i> = 0.025) group.

        "Abstract": "Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are 2 chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) that present with significant comorbidity. Both conditions are more prevalent in women and are exacerbated by stress. While peripheral mechanisms might contribute to pain hypersensitivity for each individual condition, mechanisms underlying the comorbidity are poorly understood, complicating pain management when multiple conditions are involved. In this study, longitudinal behavioral and functional MRI-based brain changes have been identified in an animal model of TMD-like pain (masseter muscle inflammation followed by stress) that induces de novo IBS-like comorbid visceral pain hypersensitivity in rats. In particular, data indicate that increased activity in the insula and regions of the reward and limbic systems are associated with more pronounced and longer-lasting visceral pain behaviors in female rats, while the faster pain resolution in male rats may be due to increased activity in descending pain inhibitory pathways. These findings suggest the critical role of brain mechanisms in chronic pain conditions and that sex may be a risk factor of developing COPCs.",

        "Abstract": "Obesity-induced skeletal muscle (SKM) inflexibility is closely linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of melatonin on the red vastus lateralis (RVL) muscle in obese rat models at the molecular and morphological levels. Five-week-old male Z\u00fccker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and their age-matched lean littermates (ZL) were orally treated either with melatonin (10 mg/kg body weight (BW)/24 h) (M-ZDF and M-ZL) or non-treated (control) (C-ZDF and C-ZL) for 12 weeks. Western blot analysis showed that mitochondrial fission, fusion, and autophagy were altered in the C-ZDF group, accompanied by reduced SIRT1 levels. Furthermore, C-ZDF rats exhibited depleted ATP production and nitro-oxidative stress, as indicated by increased nitrites levels and reduced SOD activity. Western blotting of MyH isoforms demonstrated a significant decrease in both slow and fast oxidative fiber-specific markers expression in the C-ZDF group, concomitant with an increase in the fast glycolytic fiber markers. At the tissue level, marked fiber atrophy, less oxidative fibers, and excessive lipid deposition were noted in the C-ZDF group. Interestingly, melatonin treatment partially restored mitochondrial fission/fusion imbalance in the RVL muscle by enhancing the expression of fission (Fis1 and DRP1) markers and decreasing that of fusion (OPA1 and Mfn2) markers. It was also found to restore autophagy, as indicated by increased p62 protein level and LC3BII/I ratio. In addition, melatonin treatment increased SIRT1 protein level, mitochondrial ATP production, and SOD activity and decreased nitrites production. These effects were associated with enhanced oxidative phenotype, as evidenced by amplified oxidative fiber-specific markers expression, histochemical reaction for NADH enzyme, and muscular lipid content. In this study, we showed that melatonin might have potential therapeutic implications for obesity-induced SKM metabolic inflexibility among patients with obesity and T2DM.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of developmental exposure to glyphosate and a herbicide mixture containing glyphosate, dicamba and 2-4-D on rat dams' kidney and thyroid function and offspring's health. Pregnant Wistar rats were exposed from day-6 of gestation till weaning to regulatory relevant doses of glyphosate corresponding to the European Union (EU) acceptable daily intake (ADI; 0.5\u00a0mg/kg bw/day), and the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL; 50\u00a0mg/kg bw/day), and to a mixture of glyphosate, dicamba and 2,4-D all at the EU ADI (0.5, 0.002 and 0.3\u00a0mg/kg bw/day) respectively. After weaning the dams were sacrificed and blood and organs were collected. The pups' health was assessed by measuring viability, gestational and anogenital indices. Perinatal exposure to GLY alone and the herbicide mixture resulted in anti-androgenic effects in male offspring. In dams, exposure to glyphosate resulted in kidney glomerular and tubular dysfunction as well as increased thyroid hormone levels in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, exposure to the herbicide mixture resulted in effects similar to those observed with glyphosate at the NOAEL, suggesting at least an additive effect of the herbicide mixture at doses individually considered safe for humans.",

        "Abstract": "Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is associated with the pathogenesis of intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), and metabolic disease states such as allergies, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and diabetes. SIBO is a condition characterized by an increased number (>1 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> CFU) of abnormal bacterial species in the small intestine. Interest in SIBO has gained importance due to increased awareness of the human microbiome and its potential relationships with human health and disease, which has encouraged new work in this area. In recent years, standard antibiotic regimens (rifaximin and metronidazole) have been used to treat SIBO, but solo antibiotics or their derivatives are insufficient. In this study, the therapeutic effects of the probiotic form, which contains coconut oil and traces of peppermint-lemon-patchouli essential oil, were evaluated on the Dysbiosis-Based Rat SIBO Model. There are significant differences between sick and healthy rats (<i>p</i> = 0.014), between sick rats and rats treated with the oil mix plus probiotic mix protocol (<i>p</i> = 0.026), and between rats treated with only the probiotic and only oil protocols (<i>p</i> = 0.030) in the evaluation of TNF-\u03b1 levels. Histologically, villi distortion and loss of crypts, epithelial shedding and necrotic changes in the apical regions of the villi, and inflammatory cell infiltrations extending to the lamina propria and submucosa were observed in sick rats. Mitotic figures in villus epithelium and crypts were observed in rats treated with 9.2 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/1000 mg/coconut oil + trace amounts of peppermint-lemon-patchouli essential oil and a probiotic mixture (oil + probiotic mix protocol). A regression of inflammatory reactions and an increase in goblet cells were observed. A decrease was observed in inflammation markers in sick rats. On the other hand, the oil plus probiotic mix protocol recovered digestive system defects in the animals caused by dysbiosis. In the future, these treatment approaches can be effective in the treatment of SIBO.",

        "Abstract": "The Chang-Kang-Fang (CKF) formula, a traditional Chinese herbal formula, can decrease serotonin (5-HT) levels and treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Probiotics have a better synergistic effect on diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) when combined with 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists. The present study aimed to elucidate the efficacy and the mechanisms of action of the CKF formula combined with bifid triple viable capsules (PFK) against IBS-D. The rat models of IBS-D were induced by gavage with senna decoction plus restraint stress. The CKF formula, PFK and their combination were administered to the rats. Their effects were evaluated based on general condition of the rats and the AWR score. The levels of 5-HT and fos protein in the colon and hippocampus were measured by immunohistochemistry. The levels of SP and VIP, as well as ZO-1 and occludin in the colon, were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry. The intestinal microbiota in faeces was analyzed by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that the oral CKF formula combined with PFK (CKF\u2009+\u2009PFK) could significantly relieve the symptoms of IBS-D, including elevating the weight rate and decreasing the AWR score. Compared with the MC group, administration of CKF\u2009+\u2009PFK significantly reduced the expression of fos in the colon and hippocampus and that of 5-HT, SP and VIP in the colon and increased the levels of 5-HT in the hippocampus and ZO-1 and occludin in the colon. The above indexes exhibited statistical significance in the CKF\u2009+\u2009PFK group relative to those in the other groups. Moreover, treatment with CKF\u2009+\u2009PFK improved the diversity of intestinal microbiota and the abundance of <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> but decreased those of <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and <i>Prevotellaceae</i>. The CKF formula combined with PFK may have a synergistic effect on IBS-D by slowing gastrointestinal motility, lowering visceral hypersensitivity, enhancing the intestinal barrier function and modulating the composition of intestinal microbiota.",

        "Abstract": "Electroacupuncture (EA) is well documented to treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the mechanism of the central nervous system related to IBS and acupuncture stimulation is still not well known. In this study, a rat model of IBS was established by cold-restraint comprehensive stresses for 15 days, and it was found that the levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), corticosterone (CORT), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the peripheral serum were increased; the visceral sensitivity was enhanced; and the intestinal motility was accelerated, specifically, there was an enhancement in the discharge frequency of neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). EA treatment for 3 days, 20 min/day, alleviated the increase in the levels of CRH, CORT, and ACTH in the peripheral serum of rats, reduced the visceral sensitivity of IBS rats, and inhibited colon movement and discharge frequency of the neurons in the PVN. In addition, EA could reduce the excitability of CRH neurons and the expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) and corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 (CRHR2) in PVN. At the same time, the expression of CRH, CRHR1, and CRHR2 in the peripheral colon was decreased. Taken together, EA appears to regulate intestinal functional activity through the central CRH nervous system, revealing the central regulation mechanism of EA in IBS rats, and providing a scientific research basis for the correlation among the meridians, viscera, and brain.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> The purpose of this research was to determine the central regulatory mechanism of electroacupuncture (EA) in rats with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Our results showed that combined with the serum changes in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), corticosterone (CORT), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), the improvement of IBS by EA was related to them. Furthermore, EA could regulate intestinal functional activity through the central CRH<sup>+</sup> nervous system.",

        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the typical representatives of chronic functional visceral pain that lacks effective treatment. Recently, attention has been given to the role of microglia in IBS, particularly the activation of spinal microglia and the subsequent release of Cathepsin S (Cat S), a proteolytic enzyme. However, the specific role of spinal Cat S in IBS remains to be elucidated. The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of visceral hypersensitivity in IBS-like rats by Cat S. An IBS-like rat model was developed, and visceral sensitivity was tested via the electromyographic (EMG) response to colorectal distention (CRD) and pain threshold. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to examine the expressions of proteins. The effects of inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies on visceral pain and the downstream molecular expressions were detected. The open-field test was performed to evaluate locomotor activity and anxiety-like behaviors in rats. We discovered that spinal Cat S was upregulated and colocalized with microglia in IBS-like rats. Treatment with LY3000328, a selective inhibitor of Cat S, dose-dependently down-regulated EMG amplitude and Fractalkine (FKN) expression, indicating that Cat S regulated visceral hypersensitivity via activating FKN in IBS-like rats. Furthermore, the expressions of FKN, CX3CR1, and p-p38 MAPK were elevated in IBS-like rats whereas inhibition of these molecules could alleviate visceral pain. Moreover, pharmacological inhibitor experiments suggested the activation of CX3CR1 by FKN facilitated p38 MAPK phosphorylation, which in turn promoted Cat S expression in IBS-like rats. Neonatal adverse stimulation might enhance the expression of spinal microglial Cat S, thereby activating the FKN/CX3CR1/p38 MAPK pathway and lead to visceral hypersensitivity in IBS-like rats. As a selective inhibitor of Cat S, LY3000328 could become a potential therapeutic option for IBS.",

        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder of the gut-brain axis with significant morbidity. Triptolide, an active compound extracted from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF), has been widely used as a major medicinal herb in the treatment of inflammatory disease. The chronic-acute combined stress (CAS) stimulation was used to establish IBS rat model. The model rats were then gavaged with triptolide. Forced swimming, marble-burying, fecal weight and abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) score were recorded. Pathologic changes in the ileal and colonic tissues were validated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The inflammatory cytokines and Ornithine Decarboxylase-1 (ODC1) in the ileal and colonic tissues were performed by ELISA and WB. Triptolide didn't have antidepressant- and antianxiety- effects in rats caused by CAS, but decreased fecal weight and AWR score. In addition, Triptolide reduced the release of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 and the expression of ODC1 in the ileum and colon. The therapeutic efficacy of triptolide for IBS induced by CAS was revealed in this study, which may be related to the reduction of ODC1.",

DXL-A-24 has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting neuropeptides and inflammatory factors. In this study, we used chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced IBS model, to assess the action of DXL-A-24 on visceral hypersensitivity, barrier function and microbiota. Visceral sensation was assessed by colorectal distension in a model of IBS. The expressions of substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot, the contents of diamine oxidase (DAO) and D-lactic acid were detected by ELISA, and 16S rRNA to detect the diversity of gut microbiota. CUMS reduced visceral pain threshold and increased colonic permeability of rats. DXL-A-24 for 28 days inhibited these changes. DXL-A-24 also decreased the expression of SP, CGRP in colon and D-LA, DAO in serum. Besides, DXL-A-24 increased the richness and diversity of intestinal microbiota. In conclusions, DXL-A-24 reduced visceral sensitivity, improved intestinal barrier and regulated gut microbiota in rats with IBS.",

        "Abstract": "Eluxadoline (ELD), a recently approved drug, exhibits potential therapeutic effects in the management and treatment of IBS-D. However, its applications have been limited due to poor aqueous solubility, leading to a low dissolution rate and oral bioavailability. The current study's goals are to prepare ELD-loaded eudragit (EG) nanoparticles (ENPs) and to investigate the anti-diarrheal activity on rats. The prepared ELD-loaded EG-NPs (ENP1-ENP14) were optimized with the help of Box-Behnken Design Expert software. The developed formulation (ENP2) was optimized based on the particle size (286 \u00b1 3.67 nm), PDI (0.263 \u00b1 0.01), and zeta potential (31.8 \u00b1 3.18 mV). The optimized formulation (ENP2) exhibited a sustained release behavior with maximum drug release and followed the Higuchi model. The chronic restraint stress (CRS) was successfully used to develop the IBS-D rat model, which led to increased defecation frequency. The in vivo studies revealed a significant reduction in defecation frequency and disease activity index by ENP2 compared with pure ELD. Thus, the results demonstrated that the developed eudragit-based polymeric nanoparticles can act as a potential approach for the effective delivery of eluxadoline through oral administration for irritable bowel syndrome diarrhea treatment.",

        "Title": "PIMT Controls Insulin Synthesis and Secretion through PDX1.",
        "Abstract": "Pancreatic beta cell function is an important component of glucose homeostasis. Here, we investigated the function of PIMT (PRIP-interacting protein with methyl transferase domain), a transcriptional co-activator binding protein, in the pancreatic beta cells. We observed that the protein levels of PIMT, along with key beta cell markers such as PDX1 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1) and MafA (MAF bZIP transcription factor A), were reduced in the beta cells exposed to hyperglycemic and hyperlipidemic conditions. Consistently, PIMT levels were reduced in the pancreatic islets isolated from high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The RNA sequencing analysis of PIMT knockdown beta cells identified that the expression of key genes involved in insulin secretory pathway, <i>Ins1</i> (insulin 1), <i>Ins2</i> (insulin 2), <i>Kcnj11</i> (potassium inwardly-rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11), <i>Kcnn1</i> (potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily N member 1), <i>Rab3a</i> (member RAS oncogene family), <i>Gnas</i> (GNAS complex locus), <i>Syt13</i> (synaptotagmin 13), <i>Pax6</i> (paired box 6), <i>Klf11</i> (Kruppel-Like Factor 11), and <i>Nr4a1</i> (nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1) was attenuated due to PIMT depletion. PIMT ablation in the pancreatic beta cells and in the rat pancreatic islets led to decreased protein levels of PDX1 and MafA, resulting in the reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). The results from the immunoprecipitation and ChIP experiments revealed the interaction of PIMT with PDX1 and MafA, and its recruitment to the insulin promoter, respectively. Importantly, PIMT ablation in beta cells resulted in the nuclear translocation of insulin. Surprisingly, forced expression of PIMT in beta cells abrogated GSIS, while <i>Ins1</i> and <i>Ins2</i> transcript levels were subtly enhanced. On the other hand, the expression of genes, PRIP/<i>Asc2/Ncoa6</i> (nuclear receptor coactivator 6), <i>Pax6</i>, <i>Kcnj11</i>, <i>Syt13</i>, <i>Stxbp1</i> (syntaxin binding protein 1), and <i>Snap25</i> (synaptosome associated protein 25) associated with insulin secretion, was significantly reduced, providing an explanation for the decreased GSIS upon PIMT overexpression. Our findings highlight the importance of PIMT in the regulation of insulin synthesis and secretion in beta cells.",

In the colon of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), neuron network and enteric glial cells (EGCs) in the submucosa, neuronal outgrowth in the mucosa, and expressions of neuronal factors remain unknown. IBS models were prepared by intracolonic injections of acetic acid to Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. Using whole-mount submucosal plexus tissue stripped from the distal colon, we examined neuron network, EGC morphology, and localization of both attraction factor (nerve growth factor: NGF) and repulsion factor (semaphorin3A: Sema3A). We evaluated mRNA expressions of NGF and Sema3A in the mucosa and submucosa and neuron outgrowth into the mucosa. In IBS models, nerve fibers were thickened and densely increased in the submucosa remarkably from the outer toward the inner plexus. Submucosal EGCs exhibited process hyperplasia and bulbous swelling of terminals. NGF was predominantly expressed in EGCs than neurons in the submucosa. NGF mRNA expressions were increased in the submucosa in WKY, and their expressions were increased in the mucosa after the injection. Sema3A mRNA expressions were increased in both layers of WKY but tended to be decreased in the mucosa alone after the injection. Neuron outgrowth was increased into the mucosa. NGF was localized at EGCs in the lamina propria mucosae but not mucosal mast cells. Neuron network enhancement in the submucosa and neuron outgrowth into the mucosa may be associated with axon guidance factors expressed in hyperplastic EGCs in the colonic submucosa of IBS models.",

        "Title": "Antinociceptive Effects of an Anti-CGRP Antibody in Rat Models of Colon-Bladder Cross-Organ Sensitization.",
        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC) are comorbid visceral pain disorders seen commonly in women with unknown etiology and limited treatment options and can involve visceral organ cross-sensitization. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a mediator of nociceptive processing and may serve as a target for therapy. In three rodent models, we employed a monoclonal anti-CGRP F(ab')<sub>2</sub> to investigate the hypothesis that visceral organ cross-sensitization is mediated by abnormal CGRP signaling. Visceral organ cross-sensitization was induced in adult female rats via transurethral infusion of protamine sulfate (PS) into the urinary bladder or infusion into the colon of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Colonic sensitivity was assessed via the visceromotor response to colorectal distension (CRD). Bladder sensitivity was assessed as the frequency of abdominal withdrawal reflexes to von Frey filaments applied to the suprapubic region. PS- or TNBS-induced changes in colonic and bladder permeability were investigated in vitro via quantification of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Peripheral administration of an anti-CGRP F(ab')<sub>2</sub> inhibited PS-induced visceral pain behaviors and colon hyperpermeability. Similarly, TNBS-induced pain behaviors and colon and bladder hyperpermeability were attenuated by anti-CGRP F(ab')<sub>2</sub> treatment. PS into the bladder or TNBS into the colon significantly increased the visceromotor response to CRD and abdominal withdrawal reflexes to suprapubic stimulation and decreased bladder and colon TEER. These findings suggest an important role of peripheral CGRP in visceral nociception and organ cross-sensitization and support the evaluation of CGRP as a therapeutic target for visceral pain in patients with IBS and/or BPS/IC. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: A monoclonal antibody against calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was found to reduce concomitant colonic and bladder hypersensitivity and hyperpermeability. The results of this study suggest that CGRP-targeting antibodies, in addition to migraine prevention, may provide a novel treatment strategy for multiorgan abdominopelvic pain following injury or inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "Irritable Bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly widespread gastrointestinal disorder whose symptomatology mainly affect the large intestine. Among the risk factors, psychosocial stress is the most acknowledged. The repeated water avoidance stress (rWAS) is considered an animal model of psychosocial stress that is capable of mimicking IBS. Otilonium bromide (OB), which is orally administered, concentrates in the large bowel and controls most of the IBS symptoms in humans. Several reports have shown that OB has multiple mechanisms of action and cellular targets. We investigated whether the application of rWAS to rats induced morphological and functional alterations of the cholinergic neurotransmission in the distal colon and whether OB prevented them. The results demonstrated that rWAS affects cholinergic neurotransmission by causing an increase in acid mucin secretion, in the amplitude of electrically evoked contractile responses, abolished by atropine, and in the number of myenteric neurons expressing choline acetyltransferase. OB counteracted these changes and also showed an intrinsic antimuscarinic effect on the post-synaptic muscular receptors. We assume that the rWAS consequences on the cholinergic system are linked to corticotrophin-releasing factor-1 (CRF1) receptor activation by the CRF hypothalamic hormone. OB, by interfering with the CFR/CRFr activation, interrupted the cascade events responsible for the changes affecting the rWAS rat colon.",

        "Abstract": "Reactive astrogliosis is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a clinically validated neuroimaging probe to visualize the reactive astrogliosis is yet to be discovered. Here, we show that PET imaging with 11C-acetate and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) functionally visualizes the reactive astrocyte-mediated neuronal hypometabolism in the brains with neuroinflammation and AD. To investigate the alterations of acetate and glucose metabolism in the diseased brains and their impact on the AD pathology, we adopted multifaceted approaches including microPET imaging, autoradiography, immunohistochemistry, metabolomics, and electrophysiology. Two AD rodent models, APP/PS1 and 5xFAD transgenic mice, one adenovirus-induced rat model of reactive astrogliosis, and post-mortem human brain tissues were used in this study. We further curated a proof-of-concept human study that included 11C-acetate and 18F-FDG PET imaging analyses along with neuropsychological assessments from 11 AD patients and 10 healthy control subjects. We demonstrate that reactive astrocytes excessively absorb acetate through elevated monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) in rodent models of both reactive astrogliosis and AD. The elevated acetate uptake is associated with reactive astrogliosis and boosts the aberrant astrocytic GABA synthesis when amyloid-\u03b2 is present. The excessive astrocytic GABA subsequently suppresses neuronal activity, which could lead to glucose uptake through decreased glucose transporter-3 in the diseased brains. We further demonstrate that 11C-acetate uptake was significantly increased in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and temporo-parietal neocortex of the AD patients compared to the healthy controls, while 18F-FDG uptake was significantly reduced in the same regions. Additionally, we discover a strong correlation between the patients' cognitive function and the PET signals of both 11C-acetate and 18F-FDG. We demonstrate the potential value of PET imaging with 11C-acetate and 18F-FDG by visualizing reactive astrogliosis and the associated neuronal glucose hypometablosim for AD patients. Our findings further suggest that the acetate-boosted reactive astrocyte-neuron interaction could contribute to the cognitive decline in AD.",

        "Abstract": "Orthohantaviruses, etiological agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, pose a critical public health threat worldwide. Hantaan orthohantavirus (HTNV) outbreaks are particularly endemic in Gyeonggi Province in northern area of the Republic of Korea (ROK). Small mammals were collected from three regions in the Gyeonggi Province during 2017 and 2018. Serological and molecular prevalence of HTNV was 25/201 (12.4%) and 10/25 (40%), respectively. A novel nanopore-based diagnostic assay using a cost-efficient Flongle chip was developed to rapidly and sensitively detect HTNV infection in rodent specimens within 3\u2009h. A rapid phylogeographical surveillance of HTNV at high-resolution phylogeny was established using the amplicon-based Flongle sequencing. In total, seven whole-genome sequences of HTNV were newly obtained from wild rodents collected in Paju-si (Gaekhyeon-ri) and Yeoncheon-gun (Hyeonga-ri and Wangnim-ri), Gyeonggi Province. Phylogenetic analyses revealed well-supported evolutionary divergence and genetic diversity, enhancing the resolution of the phylogeographic map of orthohantaviruses in the ROK. Incongruences in phylogenetic patterns were identified among HTNV tripartite genomes, suggesting differential evolution for each segment. These findings provide crucial insights into on-site diagnostics, genome-based surveillance, and the evolutionary dynamics of orthohantaviruses to mitigate hantaviral outbreaks in HFRS-endemic areas in the ROK.",

        "Abstract": "Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), associated with increased intestinal permeability, inflammation, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, can be triggered by acute gastroenteritis. Cytolethal distending toxin B (CdtB) is produced by gastroenteritis-causing pathogens and may underlie IBS-D development, through molecular mimicry with vinculin. Here, we examine the effects of exposure to CdtB alone on gut microbiome composition, host intestinal gene expression, and IBS-D-like phenotypes in a rat model. CdtB-inoculated rats exhibited increased anti-CdtB levels, which correlated with increased stool wet weights, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL2) and predicted microbial metabolic pathways including inflammatory responses, TNF responses, and diarrhea. Three distinct ileal microbiome profiles (microtypes) were identified in CdtB-inoculated rats. The first microtype (most like controls) had altered relative abundance (RA) of genera <i>Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus,</i> and <i>Rothia</i>. The second had lower microbial diversity, higher <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i> RA, higher absolute <i>E. coli</i> abundance, and altered host ileal tissue expression of immune-response and TNF-response genes compared to controls. The third microtype had higher microbial diversity, higher RA of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S)-producer <i>Desulfovibrio</i>, and increased expression of H<sub>2</sub>S-associated pain/serotonin response genes. All CdtB-inoculated rats exhibited decreased ileal expression of cell junction component mRNAs, including vinculin-associated proteins. Significantly, cluster-specific microRNA-mRNA interactions controlling intestinal permeability, visceral hypersensitivity/pain, and gastrointestinal motility genes, including several previously associated with IBS were seen. These findings demonstrate that exposure to CdtB toxin alone results in IBS-like phenotypes including inflammation and diarrhea-like stool, decreased expression of intestinal barrier components, and altered ileal microtypes that influenced changes in microRNA-modulated gene expression and predicted metabolic pathways consistent with specific IBS-D symptoms.",

        "Title": "Environmental enrichment reverses stress-induced changes in the brain-gut axis to ameliorate chronic visceral and somatic hypersensitivity.",
        "Abstract": "Behavioral therapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy and stress management activities, have emerged as effective treatments for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a female predominant disorder of the brain-gut axis. IBS, affecting over 10% of the global population, typically presents with abnormal bowel habits and abdominal pain due to visceral hypersensitivity. While the mechanisms underlying how behavioral therapies treat IBS are still elusive, we had previously shown that chronic stress alters gene expression in brain regions critical for stress processing and nociception. We found that exposure to an enriched environment (EE), the rodent analogue of behavioral therapies, prior to and during the stressor was sufficient to prevent stress-induced changes in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and hippocampus. Pre-exposure to EE also inhibited stress-induced increased colonic permeability and was able to block the induction of stress-induced visceral and somatic hypersensitivity. However, it remains unknown if EE can reverse chronic viscerosomatic hypersensitivity that persists following exposure to stress. We hypothesized that EE after chronic stress would be sufficient to reverse stress-induced changes in i) GR expression in the CeA and hippocampus, ii) ameliorate stress-induced colonic hyperpermeability and iii) restore normal visceral and somatic sensitivity in male and female rats. Male and female rats were exposed to daily water avoidance stress (WAS). After confirming the rats had developed visceral hypersensitivity, 50% of the animals were housed in EE for 2 weeks while the other 50% remained in standard housing (SH). At the end of this period, we assessed visceral and somatic sensitivity. We also collected colon tissue to measure colonic permeability. Micro-punches of tissue from the CeA and hippocampus were isolated to measure GR expression. Control animals not exposed to WAS were kept in SH for the duration of the study (n\u00a0=\u00a08 per group). In both male and female rats, EE reversed stress-induced visceral (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and somatic (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) hypersensitivity when compared to WAS animals housed in SH to levels comparable to control animals. EE exposure also reversed changes in GR expression in both the hippocampus (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and CeA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), normalizing GR expression to control levels. EE exposure ameliorated stress-induced colonic hyperpermeability in both male (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and female (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) rats compared to WAS rats in SH. Our findings suggest that behavioral therapies are viable therapeutic options for IBS as they can counter the stress-induced pathophysiology underlying IBS symptoms including visceral hypersensitivity, increased colonic permeability and altered gene expression.",

        "Title": "Changes in RBM47 expression based on the timing of melatonin administration and its effects on Nrf2 activity in the hippocampus.",
        "Abstract": "Melatonin is an endogenous indoleamine that plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including the sleep-wake cycle, anxiety, immunity, and circadian rhythms. However, it is important to clarify that melatonin does not directly control circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms are primarily synchronized by light, which acts on the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and subsequently regulates melatonin production. This light-mediated synchronization of circadian rhythms is essential for maintaining the alignment of the body with the light-dark cycle. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of melatonin administration during different times of the day or night and explored its neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, we aimed to apply these findings to rodent models of dementia, aging, and neuro-inflammation for potential therapeutic applications. Our study uncovered novel evidence suggesting the involvement of RNA-binding motif protein (RBM)-47 and Nrf2 in the signaling pathways associated with melatonin administration during both day and night. We examined the role of RBM47 in Nrf2 activity through siRNA or CRISPR-mediated knockdown experiments using hippocampal neuronal cells and lentivirus injections in mice. In 5xFAD/aging/neuroinflammatory mouse models, antioxidant effects were enhanced when melatonin was administered during the day compared to nighttime administration. Furthermore, mRNA analysis and molecular biology experiments revealed the differential expression of RBM47 depending on the timing of melatonin administration. These findings suggest that a decrease in RBM47 expression may improve the antioxidant defense system in the hippocampus. Consequently, administering melatonin during the day rather than at night may present a plausible therapeutic strategy as an antioxidant.",

        "Abstract": "Gait analysis could be used in animal models as an indicator of sensory ataxia due to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN). Over the years, gait analysis in in vivo studies has evolved from simple observations carried out by a trained operator to computerised systems with machine learning that allow the quantification of any variable of interest and the establishment of algorithms for behavioural classification. However, there is not a consensus on gait analysis use in CIPN animal models; therefore, we carried out a systematic review. Of 987 potentially relevant studies, 14 were included, in which different methods were analysed (observation, footprint and CatWalk\u2122). We presented the state-of-the-art of possible approaches to analyse sensory ataxia in rodent models, addressing advantages and disadvantages of different methods available. Semi-automated methods may be of interest when preventive or therapeutic strategies are evaluated, also considering their methodological simplicity and automaticity; up to now, only CatWalk\u2122 analysis has been tested. Future studies should expect that CIPN-affected animals tend to reduce hind paw support due to pain, allodynia or loss of sensation, and an increase in swing phase could or should be observed. Few available studies documented these impairments at the last time point, and only appeared later on respect to other earlier signs of CIPN (such as altered neurophysiological findings). For that reason, gait impairment could be interpreted as late repercussions of loss of sensory.",

        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC) are comorbid visceral pain disorders seen commonly in women with unknown etiology and limited treatment options and can involve visceral organ cross-sensitization. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a mediator of nociceptive processing and may serve as a target for therapy. In three rodent models, we employed a monoclonal anti-CGRP F(ab')<sub>2</sub> to investigate the hypothesis that visceral organ cross-sensitization is mediated by abnormal CGRP signaling. Visceral organ cross-sensitization was induced in adult female rats via transurethral infusion of protamine sulfate (PS) into the urinary bladder or infusion into the colon of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Colonic sensitivity was assessed via the visceromotor response to colorectal distension (CRD). Bladder sensitivity was assessed as the frequency of abdominal withdrawal reflexes to von Frey filaments applied to the suprapubic region. PS- or TNBS-induced changes in colonic and bladder permeability were investigated in vitro via quantification of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Peripheral administration of an anti-CGRP F(ab')<sub>2</sub> inhibited PS-induced visceral pain behaviors and colon hyperpermeability. Similarly, TNBS-induced pain behaviors and colon and bladder hyperpermeability were attenuated by anti-CGRP F(ab')<sub>2</sub> treatment. PS into the bladder or TNBS into the colon significantly increased the visceromotor response to CRD and abdominal withdrawal reflexes to suprapubic stimulation and decreased bladder and colon TEER. These findings suggest an important role of peripheral CGRP in visceral nociception and organ cross-sensitization and support the evaluation of CGRP as a therapeutic target for visceral pain in patients with IBS and/or BPS/IC. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: A monoclonal antibody against calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was found to reduce concomitant colonic and bladder hypersensitivity and hyperpermeability. The results of this study suggest that CGRP-targeting antibodies, in addition to migraine prevention, may provide a novel treatment strategy for multiorgan abdominopelvic pain following injury or inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "Reactive astrogliosis is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a clinically validated neuroimaging probe to visualize the reactive astrogliosis is yet to be discovered. Here, we show that PET imaging with 11C-acetate and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) functionally visualizes the reactive astrocyte-mediated neuronal hypometabolism in the brains with neuroinflammation and AD. To investigate the alterations of acetate and glucose metabolism in the diseased brains and their impact on the AD pathology, we adopted multifaceted approaches including microPET imaging, autoradiography, immunohistochemistry, metabolomics, and electrophysiology. Two AD rodent models, APP/PS1 and 5xFAD transgenic mice, one adenovirus-induced rat model of reactive astrogliosis, and post-mortem human brain tissues were used in this study. We further curated a proof-of-concept human study that included 11C-acetate and 18F-FDG PET imaging analyses along with neuropsychological assessments from 11 AD patients and 10 healthy control subjects. We demonstrate that reactive astrocytes excessively absorb acetate through elevated monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) in rodent models of both reactive astrogliosis and AD. The elevated acetate uptake is associated with reactive astrogliosis and boosts the aberrant astrocytic GABA synthesis when amyloid-\u03b2 is present. The excessive astrocytic GABA subsequently suppresses neuronal activity, which could lead to glucose uptake through decreased glucose transporter-3 in the diseased brains. We further demonstrate that 11C-acetate uptake was significantly increased in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and temporo-parietal neocortex of the AD patients compared to the healthy controls, while 18F-FDG uptake was significantly reduced in the same regions. Additionally, we discover a strong correlation between the patients' cognitive function and the PET signals of both 11C-acetate and 18F-FDG. We demonstrate the potential value of PET imaging with 11C-acetate and 18F-FDG by visualizing reactive astrogliosis and the associated neuronal glucose hypometablosim for AD patients. Our findings further suggest that the acetate-boosted reactive astrocyte-neuron interaction could contribute to the cognitive decline in AD.",

        "Abstract": "Coronary artery bypass grafting is commonly used to treat cardiovascular diseases by replacing blocked blood vessels with autologous or artificial blood vessels. Nevertheless, the availability of autologous vessels in infants and the elderly and low long-term patency rate of grafts hinder extensive application of autologous vessels in clinical practice. The biological and mechanical properties of the resealable antithrombotic artificial vascular graft (RAAVG) fabricated herein, comprising a bioelectronic conduit based on a tough self-healing polymer (T-SHP) and a lubricious inner coating, match with the functions of autologous blood vessels. The self-healing and elastic properties of the T-SHP confer resistance against mechanical stimuli and promote conformal sealing of suturing regions, thereby preventing leakage (stable fixation under a strain of 50%). The inner layer of the RAAVG presents antibiofouling properties against blood cells and proteins, and antithrombotic properties, owing to its lubricious coating. Moreover, the blood-flow sensor fabricated using the T-SHP and carbon nanotubes is seamlessly integrated into the RAAVG via self-healing and allows highly sensitive monitoring of blood flow at low and high flow rates (10- and 100 mL min<sup>-1</sup>, respectively). Biocompatibility and feasibility of RAAVG as an artificial graft were demonstrated via <i>ex vivo</i>, and <i>in vivo</i> experiment using a rodent model. The use of RAAVGs to replace blocked blood vessels can improve the long-term patency rate of coronary artery bypass grafts.",

        "Title": "Low FODMAP Diet Relieves Visceral Hypersensitivity and Is Associated with Changes in Colonic Microcirculation in Water Avoidance Mice Model.",
        "Abstract": "(1) Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a global public health problem, the pathogenesis of which has not been fully explored. Limiting fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) can relieve symptoms in some patients with IBS. Studies have shown that normal microcirculation perfusion is necessary to maintain the primary function of the gastrointestinal system. Here, we hypothesized that IBS pathogenesis might be related to abnormalities in colonic microcirculation. A low-FODMAP diet could alleviate visceral hypersensitivity (VH) by improving colonic microcirculation; (2) Methods: C57BL/6 mice were raised to establish an IBS-like rodent model using water avoidance (WA) stress or SHAM-WA as a control, one hour per day for ten days. The mice in the WA group were administered different levels of the FODMAP diet: 2.1% regular FODMAP (WA-RF), 10% high FODMAP diet (WA-HF), 5% medium FODMAP diet (WA-MF), and 0% low FODMAP diet (WA-LF) for the following 14 days. The body weight and food consumption of the mice were recorded. Visceral sensitivity was measured as colorectal distention (CRD) using the abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) score. Colonic microcirculation was assessed using laser speckle contrast imaging (LCSI). Vascular endothelial-derived growth factor (VEGF) was detected using immunofluorescence staining; (3) Results: The threshold values of CRD pressure in the WA-RF, WA-HF, and WA-MF groups were significantly lower than those in the SHAM-WA group. Moreover, we observed that colonic microcirculation perfusion decreased, and the expression of VEGF protein increased in these three groups of mice. Interestingly, a low-FODMAP dietary intervention could reverse this situation. Specifically, a low-FODMAP diet increased colonic microcirculation perfusion, reduced VEGF protein expression in mice, and increased the threshold of VH. There was a significant positive correlation between colonic microcirculation and threshold for VH; (4) Conclusions: These results demonstrate that a low-FODMAP diet can alter VH by affecting colonic microcirculation. Changes in intestinal microcirculation may be related to VEGF expression.",

        "Title": "Benzophenone-3: Comprehensive review of the toxicological and human evidence with meta-analysis of human biomonitoring studies.",
        "Abstract": "Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) and its major metabolite benzophenone-1 (BP-1) are widely used as UV filters in sunscreens and cosmetics to prevent sunburn and skin damage, or as stabilizers to prevent photodegradation in many commercial products. As a result, their presence is ubiquitous in the environment, wildlife and humans. Based on endocrine disruption concerns, international regulatory agencies are performing a closer evaluation. This work aimed to comprehensively review the available human relevant evidence for safety issues in MEDLINE/PubMed in order to create a structured database of studies, as well as to conduct an integrative analysis as part of the Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) Initiative. A total of 1,635 titles and abstracts were screened and 254 references were evaluated and tabulated in detail, and classified in different categories: i) exposure sources and predictors; ii) human biomonitoring (HBM) exposure levels to perform a meta-analysis; iii) toxicokinetic data in both experimental animals and humans; iv) in vitro and in vivo rodent toxicity studies; and v) human data on effect biomarkers and health outcomes. Our integrative analysis showed that internal peak BP-3 concentrations achieved after a single whole-body application of a commercially available sunscreen (4% w/w) may overlap with concentrations eliciting endocrine disrupting effects in vitro, and with internal concentrations causing in vivo adverse female reproductive effects in rodents that were supported by still limited human data. The adverse effects in rodents included prolonged estrous cycle, altered uterine estrogen receptor gene expression, endometrium hyperplasia and altered proliferation and histology of the mammary gland, while human data indicated menstrual cycle hormonal alterations and increased risk of uterine fibroids and endometriosis. Among the modes of action reported (estrogenic, anti-androgenic, thyroid, etc.), BP-3 and especially BP-1 showed estrogenic activity at human-relevant concentrations, in agreement with the observed alterations in female reproductive endpoints. The meta-analysis of HBM studies identified a higher concern for North Americans, showing urinary BP-3 concentrations on average 10 and 20 times higher than European and Asian populations, respectively. Our work supports that these benzophenones present endocrine disrupting properties, endorsing recent European regulatory efforts to limit human exposure. The reproducible and comprehensive database generated may constitute a point of departure in future risk assessments to support regulatory initiatives. Meanwhile, individuals should not refrain from sunscreen use. Commercially available formulations using inorganic UV filters that are practically not absorbed into systemic circulation may be recommended to susceptible populations.",

Our findings suggest that both vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and Lactoferrin could augment colonic autophagy through enhanced AMPK expression and inhibition of mTOR-STAT3 signaling, which offers practical insights into their clinical use in the prevention and therapy of IBS.

        "Abstract": "The main cause of insulin resistance in childhood is obesity, which contributes to future comorbidities as in adults. Although high-calorie diets and lack of exercise contribute to metabolic disease development, food quality rather than the quantity of macronutrients is more important than food density. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of changing the quality of carbohydrates from rapidly to slowly digestible carbohydrates on the composition of the gut microbiota and the profiles of the functional pathways in growing rats with obesity due to a high-fat diet (HFD). During the course of 4 weeks, rats growing on an HFD-containing carbohydrates with different digestive rates were fed either HFD-containing carbohydrates with a rapid digestion rate (OBE group) or HFD-containing carbohydrates with a slow digestion rate (OBE-ISR group). A non-obese group (NOB) was included as a reference, and rats were fed on a rodent standard diet (AIN93G). An analysis of gut microbiota was conducted using 16S rRNA-based metagenomics; a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) was used to determine changes in abundance between baseline and 4 weeks of treatment, and functional pathways were identified. Gut microbiota composition at bacterial diversity and relative abundance, at phylum and genus levels, and functional profiles were analyzed by integrating the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) database. The groups showed comparable gut microbiota at baseline. At the end of the treatment, animals from the ISR group exhibited differences at the phylum levels by decreasing the diversity of Fisher's index and <i>Firmicutes</i> (newly named as <i>Bacillota</i>), and increasing the Pielou's evenness and <i>Bacteroidetes</i> (newly named as <i>Bacteroidota</i>); at the genus level by increasing <i>Alistipes, Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Butyricimonas</i>, <i>Lachnoclostridium</i>, <i>Flavonifractor</i>, <i>Ruminiclostridium 5</i>, and <i>Faecalibaculum</i> and decreasing <i>Muribaculum</i>, <i>Blautia</i>, and <i>Ruminiclostridium 9</i>. Remarkably, relative abundances of genera <i>Tyzzerella</i> and <i>Angelakisella</i> were higher in the OBE group compared to NOB and OBE-ISR groups. In addition, some microbiota carbohydrate metabolism pathways such as glycolysis, glucuronic acid degradation, pentose phosphate pathway, methanogenesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis exhibited increased activity in the OBE-ISR group after the treatment. Higher levels of acetate and propionate were found in the feces of the ISR group compared with the NOB and OBE groups. The results of this study demonstrate that replacing rapidly digestible carbohydrates with slowly digestible carbohydrates within an HFD improve the composition of the gut microbiota. Consequently, metabolic disturbances associated with obesity may be prevented.",

        "Abstract": "Intrinsic exploratory biases are an innate motivation for exploring certain types of stimuli or environments over others, and they may be associated with cognitive, emotional, and even personality-like traits. However, their neurobiological basis has been scarcely investigated. Considering the involvement of the hippocampus in novelty recognition and in spatial and pattern separation tasks, this work researched the role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in intrinsic exploratory bias for a perceptually complex object in mice. Spontaneous object preference tasks revealed that both male and female C57BL/6J mice showed a consistent unconditioned preference for exploring \"complex\"-irregular-objects over simpler ones. Furthermore, increasing objects' complexity resulted in an augmented time of object exploration. In a different experiment, male mice received either vehicle or the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) for 4 weeks, a pharmacological treatment that reduced AHN as evidenced by immunohistochemistry. After assessment in a behavioral test battery, the TMZ-treated mice did not show any alterations in general exploratory and anxiety-like responses. However, when tested in the spontaneous object preference task, the TMZ-treated mice did not display enhanced exploration of the complex object, as evidenced both by a reduced exploration time-specifically for the complex object-and a lack of preference for the complex object over the simple one. This study supports a novel role of AHN in intrinsic exploratory bias for perceptual complexity. Moreover, the spontaneous complex object preference task as a rodent model of \"curiosity\" is discussed.",

        "Title": "The Effect of Serine Protease Inhibitors on Visceral Pain in Different Rodent Models With an Intestinal Insult.",
        "Abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Serine proteases are believed to play a key role in the origin of abdominal pain in IBD and IBS. We previously demonstrated a reduction of visceral pain in a post-inflammatory IBS rat model after a single intraperitoneal or intracolonic administration of a serine protease inhibitor. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of serine protease inhibition on visceral pain in two different animal models involving a colonic insult based either on acute inflammation or on neonatal irritation. Moreover, protease profiling was explored in the acute colitis model. <b>Methods:</b> An acute 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) colitis rat model and a chronic neonatal acetic acid mouse model were used in this study. Visceral sensitivity was quantified by visceromotor responses (VMRs) to colorectal distension, 30\u00a0min after intraperitoneal administration of the serine protease inhibitors nafamostat, UAMC-00050 or their vehicles. Colonic samples from acute colitis rats were used to quantify the mRNA expression of a panel of serine proteases and mast cell tryptase by immunohistochemistry. Finally, proteolytic activities in colonic and fecal samples were characterized using fluorogenic substrates. <b>Key Results:</b> We showed a significant and pressure-dependent increase in visceral hypersensitivity in acute colitis and neonatal acetic acid models. UAMC-00050 and nafamostat significantly reduced VMRs in both animal models. In acute colitis rats, the administration of a serine protease inhibitor did not affect the inflammatory parameters. Protease profiling of these acute colitis animals revealed an increased tryptase immunoreactivity and a downregulation of matriptase at the mRNA level after inflammation. The administration of UAMC-00050 resulted in a decreased elastase-like activity in the colon associated with a significantly increased elastase-like activity in fecal samples of acute colitis animals. <b>Conclusion:</b> In conclusion, our results suggest that serine proteases play an important role in visceral hypersensitivity in an acute TNBS colitis model in rats and a neonatal acetic acid model in mice. Moreover, we hypothesize a potential mechanism of action of UAMC-00050 via the alteration of elastase-like proteolytic activity in acute inflammation. Taken together, we provided fundamental evidence for serine protease inhibitors as a promising new therapeutic strategy for abdominal pain in gastrointestinal diseases.",

        "Abstract": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulators have recently received increased attention as potential therapeutics for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, we tested a novel NMDAR-positive modulator, NYX-783, in the following two rodent models of PTSD: an auditory fear-conditioning model and a single-prolonged stress (SPS) model. We examined the ability of NYX-783 to reduce subsequent fear-based behaviors by measuring enhanced fear extinction and reduced spontaneous recovery (spontaneous return of fear) in male mice. NYX-783 administration significantly reduced spontaneous recovery in both PTSD models and enhanced fear extinction in the SPS model. Furthermore, NYX-783 increased the NMDA-induced inward currents of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (IL mPFC) and that the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs on pyramidal neurons in the IL mPFC is required for its effect on spontaneous recovery. The downstream expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor was required for NYX-783 to achieve its behavioral effect. These results elucidate the cellular targets of NYX-783 and the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition of spontaneous recovery. These preclinical findings support the hypothesis that NYX-783 may have therapeutic potential for PTSD treatment and may be particularly useful for inhibiting spontaneous recovery.",

        "Abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) was considered the only member of the Hepeviridae family with zoonotic potential. Nevertheless, this consideration has been reassessed owing to several reported cases of acute and chronic hepatitis linked to the Orthohepevirus C genus. Because the circulation of Orthohepevirus C in rodents has been described worldwide, the risk of zoonotic transmission is plausibly global. Orthohepevirus C RNA was retrospectively evaluated in 2 cohorts of patients in Spain. The first cohort included patients with acute hepatitis without etiological diagnosis after screening for hepatotropic virus infection. The second cohort included patients diagnosed with acute HEV infection, defined as positivity for anti-HEV-IgM antibodies and/or detectable HEV RNA in serum. Cohort 1 comprised 169 patients (64.4% male, median age 43 years) and cohort 2 comprised 98 individuals (68.3% male, median age 45 years). Of the individuals included in Cohort 1, two (1.18%; 95% CI 0.2-3.8) had detectable Orthohepevirus C RNA in serum. In Cohort 2, of the 98 included patients, 58 showed detectable HEV RNA, while 40 only showed positivity for IgM antibodies. Among those bearing only IgM antibodies, Orthohepevirus C RNA was detected in 1 (2.5%; 95% CI 0.06-13.1) individual. All strains were consistent with genotype C1. The infection resulted in mild self-limiting acute hepatitis in 2 patients. Infection caused severe acute hepatitis in the remaining patient who died as a result of liver and renal failure. We described 3 cases of Orthohepevirus C in patients with acute hepatitis, resulting in the first description of this infection in Europe. The prevalence obtained in our study suggests that Orthohepevirus C could be an emerging disease in Europe. We describe the first cases of acute hepatitis related to rat hepatitis E virus in Europe. The prevalence found in our study suggest that rat hepatitis E virus could be considered an emerging disease in Europe.",

        "Abstract": "proving causality between an exposure and outcome can be difficult in humans. Here, we utilize the Bradford Hill (BH) criteria to summarize the causal relationship between Campylobacter infection and the development of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). we utilized the BH criteria to assess the strength, consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility, coherence, experiment, and analogy of the current evidence linking Campylobacter to IBS. Through a consensus amongst all authors, the confidence of each criterion was graded as high, moderate, low, or very low. a total of four criteria (strength, temporality, plausibility, and analogy) were graded as high; four criteria (consistency, biological gradient, coherence, and experiment) were graded as moderate; and one criterion (specificity) was graded as low. Large-scale epidemiological studies report a risk ratio of 2.7-5.6 for developing IBS after campylobacter. In rodent models, Campylobacter jejuni 81-176 can cause loose stool months after the infection is cleared and share common pathophysiology as IBS patients such as elevated intestinal TLR-4 and IL-8, antibodies to CdtB and vinculin, increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Campylobacter infection appear to cause IBS in a subset of patients. This may hold implication in risk factor identification, public health policy, and possibly treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improves the quality of life for patients with brain-gut disorders; however, the underlying mechanisms of CBT remain to be explored. Previously, we showed that environmental enrichment (EE), an experimental paradigm that mirrors positive behavioral intervention, ameliorates chronic stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity in a rodent model via mechanisms involving altered activity in the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA). In the present study, we investigated whether microglia-mediated synaptic plasticity in the CeA is a potential mechanism underlying the protective effects of EE against stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity. We stereotaxically implanted corticosterone (CORT) micropellets onto the dorsal margin of the CeA shown previously to induce colonic hypersensitivity. Animals were housed in EE cages or standard cages for 14 days after CORT implantation. Visceral sensitivity was assessed via visceromotor behavioral response to colorectal distension. Microglial morphology, microglia-mediated synaptic engulfment, and the expression of synaptic pruning-related signals complement component 1q (C1q), complement component 3 (C3), and C3 receptor (C3R) were measured using immunofluorescence and RNAscope assay. We found that housing CORT implanted rats in EE cages for 14 days attenuated visceral hypersensitivity in both male and female rats as compared with control rats maintained in standard housing. EE reduced CORT-induced microglial remodeling and microglia-mediated synaptic pruning with reduced C1q and CR3, but not C3, expression. Our data suggest that exposure to EE is sufficient to ameliorate stress-induced visceral pain via reducing amygdala microglia-modulated neuronal plasticity.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Clinical studies show that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in ameliorating visceral pain in patient with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), yet the underlying mechanisms remain unexplored. By using environmental enrichment (EE), an experimental paradigm that mirrors positive behavioral intervention, we demonstrated that microglia-mediated synaptic plasticity in the CeA explains, plays a role, at least in part, in the positive effects of EE to reduce visceral hypersensitivity.",

CRF is a signaling regulator in the neuro-endocrine-immune (NEI) network that mediates visceral hypersensitivity. Rodent models to simulate changes in intestinal motility similar to those reported in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), demonstrate that the CRF receptor 1 (CRF-R1) mediates intestinal hypersensitivity under many conditions. However, the translation of preclinical studies into clinical trials has not been successful possibly due to the lack of sufficient understanding of the multiple variants of CRF-R1 and CRF-R1 antagonists. Investigating the sites of action of central and peripheral CRF is critical for accelerating the translation from preclinical to clinical studies.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies on soft adhesives have sought to deeply understand how their chemical or mechanical structures interact strongly with living tissues. The aim is to optimally address the unmet needs of patients with acute or chronic diseases. Synergistic adhesion involving both electrostatic (hydrogen bonds) and mechanical interactions (capillarity-assisted suction stress) seems to be effective in overcoming the challenges associated with long-term unstable coupling to tissues. Here, an electrostatically and mechanically synergistic mechanism of residue-free, sustainable, in situ tissue adhesion by implementing hybrid multiscale architectonics. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored multiscale combinatory adhesive is proposed. The model supports the experimental results that the thermodynamically controlled swelling of the nanoporous hydrogel embedded in the hierarchical elastomeric structure enhances biofluid-insensitive, sustainable, in situ adhesion to diverse soft, slippery, and wet organ surfaces, as well as clean detachment in the peeling direction. Based on the robust tissue adhesion capability, universal reliable measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues, ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin, are successfully demonstrated.",

While state-of-the-art electrophysiological recording devices have been developed in recent years (<i>e.g.</i>, \u00b5LED and Neuropixels silicon probes), implantation methods for silicon probes in rats and mice have not advanced substantially for a decade. The surgery is complex, takes time to master, and involves handling expensive devices and valuable animal subjects. In addition, chronic silicon neural probes are practically single implant devices due to the current low success rate of probe recovery. To successfully recover silicon probes, improve upon the quality of electrophysiological recording, and make silicon probe recordings more accessible, we have designed a miniature, low cost, and recoverable microdrive system. The addition of a novel 3D-printed skull baseplate makes the surgery less invasive, faster, and simpler for both rats and mice.

        "Abstract": "The pro-tumorigenic activity of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19 (FGF15 in its rodent orthologue) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as the unsolved problem that ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury supposes in liver surgeries, are well known. However, it has been shown that FGF15 administration protects against liver damage and regenerative failure in liver transplantation (LT) from brain-dead donors without tumor signals, providing a benefit in avoiding IR injury. The protection provided by FGF15/19 is due to its anti-apoptotic and pro-regenerative properties, which make this molecule a potentially beneficial or harmful factor, depending on the disease. In the present review, we describe the preclinical models currently available to understand the signaling pathways responsible for the apparent controversial effects of FGF15/19 in the liver (to repair a damaged liver or to promote tumorigenesis). As well, we study the potential pharmacological use that has the activation or inhibition of FGF15/19 pathways depending on the disease to be treated. We also discuss whether FGF15/19 non-pro-tumorigenic variants, which have been developed for the treatment of liver diseases, might be promising approaches in the surgery of hepatic resections and LT using healthy livers and livers from extended-criteria donors.",

        "Abstract": "Psychological stress is a risk factor for irritable bowel syndrome, a functional gastrointestinal pain disorder featuring abnormal brain-gut connectivity. The guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) agonist linaclotide has been shown to relieve abdominal pain in IBS-C and exhibits antinociceptive effects in rodent models of post-inflammatory visceral hypersensitivity. However, the role GC-C signaling plays in psychological stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity is unknown. Here, we test the hypothesis that GC-C agonism reverses stress-induced colonic hypersensitivity via inhibition of nociceptive afferent signaling resulting in normalization of stress-altered corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) expression in brain regions involved in pain perception and modulation. Adult female rats were exposed to water avoidance stress or sham stress for 10\u00a0days, and the effects of linaclotide on stress-induced changes in colonic sensitivity, corticolimbic phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), and CRF expression were measured using a combination of behavioral assessments, immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR. Stressed rats exhibited colonic hypersensitivity and elevated corticolimbic pERK on day 11, which was inhibited by linaclotide. qRT-PCR analysis revealed dysregulated CRF expression in the medial prefrontal cortex, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and central nucleus of the amygdala on day 28. Dysregulated CRF expression was not affected by linaclotide treatment. Our results demonstrate that exposure to repeated stress induces chronic colonic hypersensitivity in conjunction with altered corticolimbic activation and CRF expression. GC-C agonism attenuated stress-induced colonic hypersensitivity and ERK phosphorylation, but had no effect on CRF expression, suggesting the analgesic effects of linaclotide occur independent of stress-driven CRF gene expression in corticolimbic circuitry.",

        "Abstract": "Forest habitats change significantly under the influence of global warming. It is important to predict the effects of these changes, especially in primeval forests which currently represent a small percentage of temperate forests. Such changes often manifest themselves in an acceleration of the frequency of mass seeding of trees, which causes cascading effects in various organisms. We evaluated changes in: tree masts (oak Quercus robur and hornbeam Carpinus betulus), rodent abundance (yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis), folivorous caterpillar abundance (winter moth Operophtera brumata), and the breeding success of a cavity-nesting songbird (collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis) in over a 30-year period in the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest (E Poland). We also analysed temperature, precipitation and snow cover to determine the effects of weather on each trophic level. Previous studies have exposed the indirect effect of tree masting on songbirds breeding in open nests. Our study uniquely highlights the relationships between trees, rodents, caterpillars, and a cavity-nesting bird. Precipitation was positively correlated with the fructification of trees, abundance of caterpillars, and the breeding losses of flycatchers (in July, August, October in the previous year, in May in the current year, respectively). We found that along with the changing climate, the frequency of mast years of oak increased, which caused an increasing frequency of rodent outbreaks. The abundance of mice was positively correlated with the predation on flycatcher broods (current year) and negatively - with the abundance of caterpillars (following year). We predict that current global trends in climate change will have a negative impact on the flycatcher due to the cascading effects from the above species. Bearing in mind that F. albicollis is one of the most numerous bird species, it can be assumed that more frequent masting will result in substantial changes in the entire bird assemblage, and presumably also other groups of animals.",

Currently several therapeutic strategies available to treat inflammatory bowel diseases. Though, most treatments can be associated with serious adverse effects what justifies the search for new treatments. In this sense, we highlight the interest in herbal products rich in bioactive compounds which immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties as is the case of <i>Bryophyllum pinnatum</i> (Crassulaceae). This plant is used in traditional medicine in Brazil for treating inflammatory diseases. We hypothesized that hydroethanolic <i>B. pinnatum</i> leaf extract has intestinal anti-inflammatory effects on two experimental colitis models: 2.4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS) in rats, and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice. Ultra-fast liquid chromatography method used for the quantification of the main compounds indicated good linearity, specificity, selectivity, precision, robustness and accuracy. The major flavonoids (mg/g of the extract) quantified were: quercetin 3-<i>O</i>-\u03b1-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1\u21922)-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranoside (35.56 \u00b1 0.086 mg/g), kaempferol 3-<i>O</i>-\u03b1-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1\u21922)-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranoside (4.66 \u00b1 0.076 mg/g) and quercetin-3-<i>O</i>-rhamnopyranoside (4.56 \u00b1 0.026 mg/g). The results obtained in the DNBS and DSS models indicate that extract has both chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory effects, observing a significant reduction in the disease activity index score, and less macroscopic and microscopic damage. The extract promoted downregulation of Toll-like receptor and <i>kappa</i> B p65 nuclear factor gene expression, leading to a reduction in pro-inflammatory and oxidative mediators, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules. This immunomodulatory property was proposed that one of the possible action mechanisms of extract. An improvement in intestinal damage was also associated with a reduction in oxidative stress and infiltration of leukocytes, as evidenced by the reduction in malonaldialdehyde and myeloperoxidase activity and increase in total glutathione in the colonic tissue. Moreover, the extract improved the cytoarchitecture of the colonic tissue and the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier by restoring the expression of the proteins associated with mucosa protection. In view of the beneficial effects showed by the <i>B. pinnatum</i> leaf extract in preclinical rodent models of colitis there is the potential to conduct some future clinical studies to ensure safe and effective development of a phytotherapeutic treatment for human inflammatory bowel diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Psychological stress is a trigger for the development of irritable bowel syndrome and associated symptoms including abdominal pain. Although irritable bowel syndrome patients show increased activation in the limbic brain, including the amygdala, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating visceral nociception in the central nervous system are incompletely understood. In a rodent model of chronic stress, we explored the role of microglia in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) in controlling visceral sensitivity. Microglia are activated by environmental challenges such as stress, and are able to modify neuronal activity via synaptic remodeling and inflammatory cytokine release. Inflammatory gene expression and microglial activity are regulated negatively by nuclear glucocorticoid receptors (GR), which are suppressed by the stress-activated pain mediator p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Fisher-344 male rats were exposed to water avoidance stress (WAS) for 1 hour per day for 7 days. Microglia morphology and the expression of phospho-p38 MAPK and GR were analyzed via immunofluorescence. Microglia-mediated synaptic remodeling was investigated by quantifying the number of postsynaptic density protein 95-positive puncta. Cytokine expression levels in the CeA were assessed via quantitative polymerase chain reaction and a Luminex assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Stereotaxic infusion into the CeA of minocycline to inhibit, or fractalkine to activate, microglia was followed by colonic sensitivity measurement via a visceromotor behavioral response to isobaric graded pressures of tonic colorectal distension. WAS induced microglial deramification in the CeA. Moreover, WAS induced a 3-fold increase in the expression of phospho-p38 and decreased the ratio of nuclear GR in the microglia. The number of microglia-engulfed postsynaptic density protein 95-positive puncta in the CeA was increased 3-fold by WAS, while cytokine levels were unchanged. WAS-induced changes in microglial morphology, microglia-mediated synaptic engulfment in the CeA, and visceral hypersensitivity were reversed by minocycline whereas in stress-na\u00efve rats, fractalkine induced microglial deramification and visceral hypersensitivity. Our data show that chronic stress induces visceral hypersensitivity in male rats and is associated with microglial p38 MAPK activation, GR dysfunction, and neuronal remodeling in the CeA.",

        "Title": "Pattern recognition analysis of directional intravoxel incoherent motion MRI in ischemic rodent brains.",
        "Abstract": "This study aimed to demonstrate a reliable automatic segmentation method for independently separating reduced diffusion and decreased perfusion areas in ischemic stroke brains using constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (cNMF) pattern recognition in directional intravoxel incoherent motion MRI (IVIM-MRI). First, the feasibility of cNMF-based segmentation of IVIM signals was investigated in both simulations and in vivo experiments. The cNMF analysis was independently performed for S<sub>0</sub> -normalized and scaled (by the difference between the maximum and minimum) IVIM signals, respectively. Segmentations of reduced diffusion (from S<sub>0</sub> -normalized IVIM signals) and decreased perfusion (from scaled IVIM signals) areas were performed using the corresponding cNMF pattern weight maps. Second, Monte Carlo simulations were performed for directional IVIM signals to investigate the relationship between the degree of vessel alignment and the direction of the diffusion gradient. Third, directional IVIM-MRI experiments (x, y and z diffusion-gradient directions, 20 b values at 7 T) were performed for normal (n = 4), sacrificed (n = 1, no flow) and ischemic stroke models (n = 4, locally reduced flow). The results showed that automatic segmentation of the hypoperfused lesion using cNMF analysis was more accurate than segmentation using the conventional double-exponential fitting. Consistent with the simulation, the double-exponential pattern of the IVIM signals was particularly strong in white matter and ventricle regions when the directional flows were aligned with the applied diffusion-gradient directions. cNMF analysis of directional IVIM signals allowed robust automated segmentation of white matter, ventricle, vascular and hypoperfused regions in the ischemic brain. In conclusion, directional IVIM signals were simultaneously sensitive to diffusion and aligned flow and were particularly useful for automatically segmenting ischemic lesions via cNMF-based pattern recognition.",

        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder that affects an estimated 11% of people across the world. IBS patients are one of the largest subgroups seen in gastroenterology clinics, exhibit a lesser quality of life, and take greater use of the healthcare system. The exact etiology of IBS remains uncertain. Alterations in the gut microbiome may characterize apotential mechanism in the pathogenesis of IBS. This hypothesis is paralleled by rodent models in which manipulation of the gut microbiota leads to disturbed physiological functions along the brain-gut axis. Recent research in IBS treatments has redirected its focus towards gu microbiome based therapeutics. In this review, we discuss potential roles of enteric bacteria in the pathogenesis of IBS and its comorbidities. We then explore the manipulation of the enteric microbiota by prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics, dietary changes, and fecal microbiota transfer. We also discuss the positive and negative effects of these therapeutics on IBS symptoms.",

        "Title": "Increased Antiangiogenic Effect by Blocking CCL2-dependent Macrophages in a Rodent Glioblastoma Model: Correlation Study with Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast Perfusion MRI.",
        "Abstract": "When glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents, it commonly exhibits tumor progression due to the development of resistance, which results in a dismal survival rate. GBM tumors contain a large number of monocytes/macrophages, which have been shown to be resistant to the effects of bevacizumab. It has been reported that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote resistance to bevacizumab treatment. Therefore, it is important to target TAMs in the GBM microenvironment. TAMs, which depend on chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) for differentiation and survival, induce the expression of proangiogenic factors such as VEGF. Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MR imaging is an advanced technique that provides information on tumor blood volume and can potentially predict the response to several treatments, including anti-angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab, in human GBM. In this study, we used a CCL2 inhibitor, mNOX-E36, to suppress the recruitment of TAMs in a CCL2-expressing rat GBM model and investigated the effect of combination therapy with bevacizumab using DSC-MR imaging. We demonstrated that the inhibition of CCL2 blocked macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis, which resulted in decreased tumor volume and blood volume in CCL2-expressing GBM in a rat model. Our results provide direct evidence that CCL2 expression can increase the resistance to bevacizumab, which can be assessed noninvasively with the DSC-MR imaging technique. This study shows that the suppression of CCL2 can play an important role in increasing the efficacy of anti-angiogenic treatment in GBM by inhibiting the recruitment of CCL2-dependent macrophages.",

        "Abstract": "Probiotics have been reported to be the active component used in the treatment of many functional gastrointestinal symptoms and syndromes. Lactobacillus and yeast culture are extensively used in probiotic supplements and traditional treatments for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of probiotic treatments (Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB12 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii) on the behavioral response, targeted gene expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels of Pi (Post infectious)-IBS -induced mice. Pathogen-free male C57L/B6 mice and the Trichinella-infected mice were used to measure the score of abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR). To compare molecular, biological and biochemical evidences of given probiotics with normal and positive control groups in mice, we conducted quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blotting, and cytokine analysis. Pi-IBS-induced immune response was confirmed that PAR-2 mRNA level was significantly increased by Trichinella infection (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The reduction of Pi-IBS symptoms through Trichinella infection and the effects of given probiotics were confirmed by a change in the protein levels of cytokines (P\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, the administration of DW (Daewon) probiotics significantly decreased serum levels of IL-1 and IL-6 (P\u2009<\u20090.05). We have demonstrated that the given probiotics decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in both the control and Pi-IBS induced mice. Taken all the results together, the results support that DW probiotics has a potential as a probiotic medication for patient with IBS via regulating TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 protein levels and serum IL-1 and IL-6 levels.",

        "Abstract": "Forepaw somatosensory stimulation induces neural activities in relay thalamic nuclei, the primary somatosensory cortex of forelimb (S1FL), and the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). However, rodent fMRI studies of somatosensory stimulation have commonly reported BOLD changes only in S1FL, which may be due to side effects of anesthetics and/or the low sensitivity in the thalamus. Thus, we have obtained mouse BOLD fMRI under newly-adopted ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. High-resolution BOLD fMRI obtained with same imaging parameters at 9.4T versus 15.2T shows the improvement of functional detectability by\u202f\u2265\u202f2 times at 15.2T due to higher signal intensity and larger BOLD response. The fMRI responses at 15.2T were robustly observed at well-known somatosensory networks including thalamus. Second, echo-time-dependent BOLD signals are dominant based on multi-echo fMRI data. A ratio of BOLD responses in S1FL to thalamus is \u223c2, which is not related to different baseline T<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2217</sup> or different cerebral blood volume. Third, group-averaged 15.2T BOLD maps show activities in S1FL, S2, motor cortices, and thalamic nuclei, which agree well with neural tracing network data from the Allen Institute, demonstrating that fMRI detects entire somatosensory networks. Our data suggest that ultrahigh field fMRI provides a unique window into understanding functional networks in normal and transgenic mouse models noninvasively.",

        "Abstract": "The neurocognitive ability to recognize and share the mental states of others is crucial for our emotional experience and social interaction. Extensive human studies have informed our understanding of the psychobehavioral and neurochemical bases of empathy. Recent evidence shows that simple forms of empathy are conserved from rodents to humans, and rodent models have become particularly useful for understanding the neurobiological correlates of empathy. In this review, we first summarize aspects of empathy at the behavioral and neural circuit levels, and describe recent developments in rodent model behavioral paradigms. We then highlight different neurobiological pathways involved in empathic abilities, with special emphasis on genetic polymorphisms associated with individual differences in empathy. By directly assessing various neurochemical correlates at molecular and neural circuit levels using relevant animal models, we conclude with the suggestion that rodent research can significantly advance our understanding of the neural basis of empathy.

        "Abstract": "Background and Purpose- Despite early aneurysm repair and aggressive management for complications, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) results in at least 25% mortality rate and 50% persistent neurological deficit. We investigated whether ceria nanoparticles which have potent antioxidative activities can protect against subarachnoid hemorrhage via attenuating fatal brain injuries. Methods- Uniform, 3 nm, water-dispersed ceria nanoparticles were prepared from short sol-gel reaction of cerium (III) ions with aminocaproic acid in aqueous phase. SAH was induced by endovascular perforation of middle cerebral artery of rats. A single dose of ceria nanoparticles (0.5 mg Ce/kg) or saline control was randomly administered intravenously at an hour post-SAH. Neuronal death, macrophage infiltration, SAH grade, and brain edema were evaluated at 72 hours. Mortality and neurological function were assessed for 14 days. Results- The obtained ceria nanoparticles with high Ce<sup>3+</sup> to Ce<sup>4+</sup> ratio demonstrated potent antioxidative, cytoprotective, and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro. In rodent SAH models, the severity of hemorrhage was comparable between the ceria nanoparticles- and saline-treated groups. However, ceria nanoparticles significantly reduced neuronal death, macrophage infiltration, and brain edema after SAH. Ceria nanoparticles successfully improved survival rates (88.2% in the ceria nanoparticles group versus 21.1% in the control group; P<0.001) and neurological outcomes (modified Garcia score: 12.1\u00b10.5 in the ceria nanoparticles group versus 4.4\u00b10.5 in the control group; P<0.001) of the animals with SAH. Conclusions- Ceria nanoparticles, totally synthesized in aqueous phase using aminocaproic acid, demonstrated promising results against SAH via potent antioxidative, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities. Given the obvious limitations of current therapies for SAH, ceria nanoparticles can be a potential therapeutic agent which might result in a paradigm shift in SAH treatment.",

        "Title": "Aluminum Ingestion Promotes Colorectal Hypersensitivity in Rodents.",
        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifactorial disease arising from a complex interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental influences. To date, environmental triggers are not well known. Aluminum is commonly present in food, notably by its use as food additive. We investigated the effects of aluminum ingestion in rodent models of visceral hypersensitivity, and the mechanisms involved. Visceral hypersensitivity was recorded by colorectal distension in rats administered with oral low doses of\u00a0aluminum. Inflammation was analyzed in the colon of aluminum-treated rats by quantitative PCR for cytokine expression and by immunohistochemistry for immune cells quantification. Involvement of mast cells in the aluminum-induced hypersensitivity was determined by cromoglycate administration of rats and in mast cell-deficient mice (Kit<sup>W-sh/W-sh</sup>). Proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) activation in response to aluminum was evaluated and its implication in aluminum-induced hypersensitivity was assessed in PAR2 knockout mice. Orally administered low-dose aluminum induced visceral hypersensitivity in rats and mice. Visceral pain induced by aluminum persisted over time even after cessation of treatment, reappeared and was amplified when treatment resumed. As observed in humans, female animals were more sensitive than males. Major mediators of nociception were up-regulated in the colon by aluminum. Activation of mast cells and PAR2 were required for aluminum-induced hypersensitivity. These findings indicate that oral exposure to aluminum at human dietary level reproduces clinical and molecular features of IBS, highlighting a new pathway of prevention and treatment of visceral pain in some susceptible patients.",

        "Abstract": "Abdominal pain represents a significant complaint in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). While the etiology of IBS is incompletely understood, prior exposure to gastrointestinal inflammation or psychologic stress is frequently associated with the development of symptoms. Inflammation or stress-induced expression of growth factors or cytokines may contribute to the pathophysiology of IBS. Here, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the receptor of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, rearranged during transfection (RET), in experimental models of inflammation and stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity resembling IBS sequelae. In RET-cyan fluorescent protein [(CFP) Ret<sup>CFP/+</sup>] mice, thoracic and lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia were shown to express RET, which colocalized with calcitonin gene-related peptide. To understand the role of RET in visceral nociception, we employed GSK3179106 as a potent, selective, and gut-restricted RET kinase inhibitor. Colonic hyperalgesia, quantified as exaggerated visceromotor response to graded pressures (0-60 mm Hg) of isobaric colorectal distension (CRD), was produced in multiple rat models induced 1) by colonic irritation, 2) following acute colonic inflammation, 3) by adulthood stress, and 4) by early life stress. In all the rat models, RET inhibition with GSK3179106 attenuated the number of abdominal contractions induced by CRD. Our findings identify a role for RET in visceral nociception. Inhibition of RET kinase with a potent, selective, and gut-restricted small molecule may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IBS through the attenuation of post-inflammatory and stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity.",

        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder characterized by abdominal pain and abnormal bowel habits, both of which are exacerbated by psychological stress. The translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO) is a marker of reactive gliosis in a number of central nervous system (CNS) diseases and responsible for many cellular functions, including neurosteroidogenesis. Although it has been reported that psychological stress disturbs neurosteroids levels, the pathophysiological relevance of TSPO in IBS is poorly understood. We examined the effects of a TSPO antagonist, ONO-2952, on stress-induced stool abnormality and abdominal pain in rats, and on anxiety-related behavior induced by cholecystokinin. Oral administration of ONO-2952 attenuated stress-induced defecation and rectal hyperalgesia in rats with an efficacy equivalent to that of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist. In addition, ONO-2952 suppressed cholecystokinin-induced anxiety-like behavior with an efficacy equivalent to that of psychotropic drugs. On the other hand, ONO-2952 did not affect spontaneous defecation, gastrointestinal transit, visceral nociceptive threshold, and neurosteroid production in non-stressed rats even at a dose 10 times higher than its effective dose in the stress models. These results suggest that TSPO antagonism results in antistress action, and that ONO-2952 is a promising candidate for IBS without side effects associated with current treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Tryptamine, a tryptophan-derived monoamine similar to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is produced by gut bacteria and is abundant in human and rodent feces. However, the physiologic effect of tryptamine in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract remains unknown. Here, we show that the biological effects of tryptamine are mediated through the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>4</sub>R), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) uniquely expressed in the colonic epithelium. Tryptamine increases both ionic flux across the colonic epithelium and fluid secretion in colonoids from germ-free (GF) and humanized (ex-GF colonized with human stool) mice, consistent with increased intestinal secretion. The secretory effect of tryptamine is dependent on 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R activation and is blocked by 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R antagonist and absent in 5-HT<sub>4</sub>R<sup>-/-</sup> mice. GF mice colonized by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron engineered to produce tryptamine exhibit accelerated GI transit. Our study demonstrates an aspect of host physiology under control of a bacterial metabolite that can be exploited as a therapeutic modality. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",

        "Title": "Human visceral nociception: findings from translational studies in human tissue.",
        "Abstract": "Peripheral sensitization of nociceptors during disease has long been recognized as a leading cause of inflammatory pain. However, a growing body of data generated over the last decade has led to the increased understanding that peripheral sensitization is also an important mechanism driving abdominal pain in highly prevalent functional bowel disorders, in particular, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). As such, the development of drugs that target pain-sensing nerves innervating the bowel has the potential to be a successful analgesic strategy for the treatment of abdominal pain in both organic and functional gastrointestinal diseases. Despite the success of recent peripherally restricted approaches for the treatment of IBS, not all drugs that have shown efficacy in animal models of visceral pain have reduced pain end points in clinical trials of IBS patients, suggesting innate differences in the mechanisms of pain processing between rodents and humans and, in particular, how we model disease states. To address this gap in our understanding of peripheral nociception from the viscera and the body in general, several groups have developed experimental systems to study nociception in isolated human tissue and neurons, the findings of which we discuss in this review. Studies of human tissue identify a repertoire of human primary afferent subtypes comparable to rodent models including a nociceptor population, the targeting of which will shape future analgesic development efforts. Detailed mechanistic studies in human sensory neurons combined with unbiased RNA-sequencing approaches have revealed fundamental differences in not only receptor/channel expression but also peripheral pain pathways.",

Linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) agonist, relieves abdominal pain and bowel symptoms in adult patients suffering from IBS with constipation. Here, we test the hypothesis that linaclotide will reverse colon and bladder hyperalgesia in a female-specific rodent model of adverse early life experience. Neonatal rats were exposed to an odor-attachment learning paradigm of early life stress (ELS). In adulthood, the effect of linaclotide (3\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> \u00a0d<sup>-1</sup> , p.o.) on colonic and bladder sensitivity was assessed via quantification of the visceromotor response to colorectal distension and the frequency of withdrawal responses to the application of von Frey hairs to the suprapubic region. In another cohort of rats, the effect of linaclotide on ELS-induced colonic and bladder permeability was investigated via measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Rats exposed to unpredictable ELS exhibited colonic and bladder hypersensitivity that was significantly reduced by linaclotide compared to vehicle-treated controls. Colonic and bladder tissue isolated from adult rats exposed to unpredictable ELS exhibited a decrease in colonic and bladder TEER that was reversed by linaclotide. Our results demonstrate that neonatal rats exposed to unpredictable ELS develop increased sensitivity and permeability of the colon and bladder in adulthood through a mechanism involving activation of peripheral GC-C signaling.",

        "Abstract": "The caudal region of the rodent striatum, called the tail of the striatum (TS), is a relatively small area but might have a distinct function from other striatal subregions. Recent primate studies showed that this part of the striatum has a unique function in encoding long-term value memory of visual objects for habitual behavior. This function might be due to its specific connectivity. We identified inputs to the rat TS and compared those with inputs to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) in the same animals. The TS directly received anatomical inputs from both sensory structures and value-coding regions, but the DMS did not. First, inputs from the sensory cortex and sensory thalamus to the TS were found; visual, auditory, somatosensory and gustatory cortex and thalamus projected to the TS but not to the DMS. Second, two value systems innervated the TS; dopamine and serotonin neurons in the lateral part of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and dorsal raphe nucleus projected to the TS, respectively. The DMS received inputs from the separate group of dopamine neurons in the medial part of the SNc. In addition, learning-related regions of the limbic system innervated the TS; the temporal areas and the basolateral amygdala selectively innervated the TS, but not the DMS. Our data showed that both sensory and value-processing structures innervated the TS, suggesting its plausible role in value-guided sensory-motor association for habitual behavior.",

This increased comorbidity between chronic pelvic pain syndromes, and with pain disorders of disparate body regions, as well as with mood disorders, can be influenced by disruptions in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which regulates the response to stress and influences the perception of pain. Experiencing trauma, neglect, or abuse in early life can permanently affect the functioning of the HPA axis. As such, a significant proportion of patients suffering from comorbid chronic pelvic pain syndromes report a history of early life stress or trauma. Here we will report on how these early life experiences influence chronic pelvic pain in patients. We will also discuss various rodent models that have been developed to study this phenomenon to understand the mechanisms underlying HPA axis dysfunction, as well as potential underlying mechanisms connecting these syndromes to one another.",

        "Abstract": "Cell-based therapies are attractive for treating various degenerative disorders and cancer but delivering functional cells to the region of interest in vivo remains difficult. The problem is exacerbated in dense biological matrices such as solid tissues because these environments impose significant steric hindrances for cell movement. Here, we show that neural stem cells transfected with zinc-doped ferrite magnetic nanoparticles (ZnMNPs) can be pulled by an external magnet to migrate to the desired location in the brain. These magnetically labeled cells (Mag-Cells) can migrate because ZnMNPs\u00a0generate sufficiently strong mechanical forces to overcome steric hindrances in the brain tissues. Once at the site of lesion, Mag-Cells show enhanced neuronal differentiation and greater secretion of neurotrophic factors than unlabeled control stem cells. Our study shows that ZnMNPs activate zinc-mediated Wnt signaling to facilitate neuronal differentiation. When implemented in a rodent brain stroke model, Mag-Cells led to significant recovery of locomotor performance in the impaired limbs of the animals. Our findings provide a simple magnetic method for controlling migration of stem cells with high therapeutic functions, offering a valuable tool for other cell-based therapies.",

        "Title": "Stress-Induced Chronic Visceral Pain of Gastrointestinal Origin.",
        "Abstract": "Visceral pain is generally poorly localized and characterized by hypersensitivity to a stimulus such as organ distension. In concert with chronic visceral pain, there is a high comorbidity with stress-related psychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression. The mechanisms linking visceral pain with these overlapping comorbidities remain to be elucidated. Evidence suggests that long term stress facilitates pain perception and sensitizes pain pathways, leading to a feed-forward cycle promoting chronic visceral pain disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Early life stress (ELS) is a risk-factor for the development of IBS, however the mechanisms responsible for the persistent effects of ELS on visceral perception in adulthood remain incompletely understood. In rodent models, stress in adult animals induced by restraint and water avoidance has been employed to investigate the mechanisms of stress-induce pain. ELS models such as maternal separation, limited nesting, or odor-shock conditioning, which attempt to model early childhood experiences such as neglect, poverty, or an abusive caregiver, can produce chronic, sexually dimorphic increases in visceral sensitivity in adulthood. Chronic visceral pain is a classic example of gene \u00d7 environment interaction which results from maladaptive changes in neuronal circuitry leading to neuroplasticity and aberrant neuronal activity-induced signaling. One potential mechanism underlying the persistent effects of stress on visceral sensitivity could be epigenetic modulation of gene expression. While there are relatively few studies examining epigenetically mediated mechanisms involved in visceral nociception, stress-induced visceral pain has been linked to alterations in DNA methylation and histone acetylation patterns within the brain, leading to increased expression of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters. This review will discuss the potential neuronal pathways and mechanisms responsible for stress-induced exacerbation of chronic visceral pain. Additionally, we will review the importance of specific experimental models of adult stress and ELS in enhancing our understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms of pain processing.",

        "Title": "Gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells correlate with salience network activity in chronic visceral pain: A pilot study.",
        "Abstract": "Distinct gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) consistent with increased sympathetic nervous system activity have been described in different populations under chronic stress. Neuroinflammatory brain changes, possibly related to the migration of primed monocytes to the brain, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of chronic pain. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a stress-sensitive gastrointestinal disorder associated with altered brain-gut interactions and increased sympathetic/vagal tone and anxiety. Reports about immune alterations in IBS are conflicting. This pilot study aimed to test how PBMC gene expression inflammatory profiles are correlated with altered brain signatures in the salience system. Sixteen IBS and 16 healthy controls (HCs) completed resting state MRI scans. Gene expression profiles in PBMCs were assessed using human transcriptome array-2. Bioinformatic analyses determined differential expression of PBMCs between IBS and HCs. Partial least squares, a multivariate analysis technique, was used to identify disease correlations between PBMC gene expression profiles and functional activity in the brain's salience network. Regions of the salience network, including the mid cingulate cortex, and mid and superior temporal gyrus were positively correlated with several pro-inflammatory genes (interleukin 6, APOL2) in IBS, but negatively correlated with several anti-inflammatory genes (KRT8, APOA4) in HCs. Based on rodent studies, one may speculate that chronically activated stress signaling pathways in IBS maintain a pro-inflammatory state in the periphery. Alternatively, primed monocytes may migrate to the brain during stress, inducing regional neuroinflammatory changes in salience regions involved in the modulation of visceral sensitivity.",

        "Title": "Ion channels, ion channel receptors, and visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Ion channels are expressed throughout the gastrointestinal system and regulate nearly every aspect of digestion, including fluid secretion and absorption, motility, and visceral sensitivity. It is therefore not surprising that in the setting of functional bowel disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ion channels are often altered in terms of expression level and function and are a target of pharmacological intervention. This is particularly true of their role in driving abdominal pain through visceral hypersensitivity (VH), which is the main reason IBS patients seek medical care. In the study by Scanzi et\u00a0al., in the current issue of this journal, they provide evidence that the T-type voltage-gated calcium channel (Ca<sub>v</sub> ) Ca<sub>v</sub> 3.2 is upregulated in human IBS patients, and is necessary for the induction of an IBS-like disease state in mice. In this mini-review, we will discuss the contribution of specific ion channels to VH in IBS, both in human patients and rodent models. We will also discuss how Ca<sub>v</sub> 3.2 may play a role as an integrator of multiple environmental stimuli contributing toward VH.",

        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional bowel disorder characterized by abdominal pain and visceral hypersensitivity. Reducing visceral hypersensitivity is the key to effectively relieving abdominal pain in IBS. Increasing evidence has confirmed that the thalamic nucleus reuniens (Re) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurotransmitter system play an important role in the development of colorectal visceral pain, whereas the exact mechanisms remain largely unclear. In this study, we found that high expression of the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors in the Re glutamatergic neurons promoted colorectal visceral pain. Specifically, we found that neonatal maternal deprivation (NMD) mice exhibited visceral hyperalgesia and enhanced spontaneous synaptic transmission in the Re brain region. Colorectal distension (CRD) stimulation induced a large amount of c-Fos expression in the Re brain region of NMD mice, predominantly in glutamatergic neurons. Furthermore, optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic neuronal activity in the Re altered colorectal visceral pain responses in CON and NMD mice. In addition, we demonstrated that 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor expression on the Re glutamatergic neurons was upregulated and ultimately promoted colorectal visceral pain in NMD mice. These findings suggest a critical role of the 5HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors on the Re glutamatergic neurons in the regulation of colorectal visceral pain.",

        "Title": "Autologous patient-derived exhausted nano T-cells exploit tumor immune evasion to engage an effective cancer therapy.",
        "Abstract": "Active targeting by surface-modified nanoplatforms enables a more precise and elevated accumulation of nanoparticles within the tumor, thereby enhancing drug delivery and efficacy for a successful cancer treatment. However, surface functionalization involves complex procedures that increase costs and timelines, presenting challenges for clinical implementation. Biomimetic nanoparticles (BNPs) have emerged as unique drug delivery platforms that overcome the limitations of actively targeted nanoparticles. Nevertheless, BNPs coated with unmodified cells show reduced functionalities such as specific tumor targeting, decreasing the therapeutic efficacy. Those challenges can be overcome by engineering non-patient-derived cells for BNP coating, but these are complex and cost-effective approaches that hinder their wider clinical application. Here we present an immune-driven strategy to improve nanotherapeutic delivery to tumors. Our unique perspective harnesses T-cell exhaustion and tumor immune evasion to develop a groundbreaking new class of BNPs crafted from exhausted T-cells (NExT) of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients by specific culture methods without sophisticated engineering. NExT were generated by coating PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) nanoparticles with TNBC-derived T-cells exhausted in vitro by acute activation. Physicochemical characterization of NExT was made by dynamic light scattering, electrophoretic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, and preservation and orientation of immune checkpoint receptors by flow cytometry. The efficacy of chemotherapy-loaded NExT was assessed in TNBC cell lines in vitro. In vivo toxicity was made in CD1 mice. Biodistribution and therapeutic activity of NExT were determined in cell-line- and autologous patient-derived xenografts in immunodeficient mice. We report a cost-effective approach with a good performance that provides NExT naturally endowed with immune checkpoint receptors (PD1, LAG3, TIM3), augmenting specific tumor targeting by engaging cognate ligands, enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy, and disrupting the PD1/PDL1 axis in an immunotherapy-like way. Autologous patient-derived NExT revealed exceptional intratumor accumulation, heightened chemotherapeutic index and efficiency, and targeted the tumor stroma in a PDL1<sup>+</sup> patient-derived xenograft model of triple-negative breast cancer. These advantages underline the potential of autologous patient-derived NExT to revolutionize tailored adoptive cancer nanotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy, which endorses their widespread clinical application of autologous patient-derived NExT.",

        "Title": "Loss of Katnal2 leads to ependymal ciliary hyperfunction and autism-related phenotypes in mice.",
        "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) frequently accompany macrocephaly, which often involves hydrocephalic enlargement of brain ventricles. Katnal2 is a microtubule-regulatory protein strongly linked to ASD, but it remains unclear whether Katnal2 knockout (KO) in mice leads to microtubule- and ASD-related molecular, synaptic, brain, and behavioral phenotypes. We found that Katnal2-KO mice display ASD-like social communication deficits and age-dependent progressive ventricular enlargements. The latter involves increased length and beating frequency of motile cilia on ependymal cells lining ventricles. Katnal2-KO hippocampal neurons surrounded by enlarged lateral ventricles show progressive synaptic deficits that correlate with ASD-like transcriptomic changes involving synaptic gene down-regulation. Importantly, early postnatal Katnal2 re-expression prevents ciliary, ventricular, and behavioral phenotypes in Katnal2-KO adults, suggesting a causal relationship and a potential treatment. Therefore, Katnal2 negatively regulates ependymal ciliary function and its deletion in mice leads to ependymal ciliary hyperfunction and hydrocephalus accompanying ASD-related behavioral, synaptic, and transcriptomic changes.",

        "Abstract": "Sensory abnormalities are observed in ~90% of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. GluN2B, an NMDA receptor subunit that regulates long-term depression and circuit refinement during brain development, has been strongly implicated in ASD, but whether GRIN2B mutations lead to sensory abnormalities remains unclear. Here, we report that Grin2b-mutant mice show behavioral sensory hypersensitivity and brain hyperconnectivity associated with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Grin2b-mutant mice with a patient-derived C456Y mutation (Grin2b<sup>C456Y/+</sup>) show sensory hypersensitivity to mechanical, thermal, and electrical stimuli through supraspinal mechanisms. c-fos and functional magnetic resonance imaging indicate that the ACC is hyperactive and hyperconnected with other brain regions under baseline and stimulation conditions. ACC pyramidal neurons show increased excitatory synaptic transmission. Chemogenetic inhibition of ACC pyramidal neurons normalizes ACC hyperconnectivity and sensory hypersensitivity. These results suggest that GluN2B critically regulates ASD-related cortical connectivity and sensory brain functions.",

        "Abstract": "Coenzyme Q (CoQ) deficiency syndrome is conventionally treated with limited efficacy using exogenous CoQ<sub>10</sub>. Poor outcomes result from low absorption and bioavailability of CoQ<sub>10</sub> and the clinical heterogenicity of the disease. Here, we demonstrate that supplementation with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4HB), the precursor of the benzoquinone ring in the CoQ biosynthetic pathway, completely rescues multisystemic disease and perinatal lethality in a mouse model of CoQ deficiency. 4HB stimulates endogenous CoQ biosynthesis in tissues of Coq2 mutant mice, normalizing mitochondrial function and rescuing cardiac insufficiency, edema, and neurodevelopmental delay. In contrast, exogenous CoQ<sub>10</sub> supplementation falls short in fully restoring the phenotype. The treatment is translatable to human use, as proven by in\u00a0vitro studies in skin fibroblasts from patients with pathogenic variants in COQ2. The therapeutic approach extends to other disorders characterized by deficiencies in the production of 4HB and early steps of CoQ biosynthesis and instances of secondary CoQ deficiency.",

        "Title": "Chitin-glucan improves important pathophysiological features of irritable bowel syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most frequent and debilitating conditions leading to gastroenterological referrals. However, recommended treatments remain limited, yielding only limited therapeutic gains. Chitin-glucan (CG) is a novel dietary prebiotic classically used in humans at a dosage of 1.5-3.0 g/d and is considered a safe food ingredient by the European Food Safety Authority. To provide an alternative approach to managing patients with IBS, we performed preclinical molecular, cellular, and animal studies to evaluate the role of chitin-glucan in the main pathophysiological mechanisms involved in IBS. To evaluate the roles of CG in visceral analgesia, intestinal inflammation, barrier function, and to develop computational molecular models. Visceral pain was recorded through colorectal distension (CRD) in a model of long-lasting colon hypersensitivity induced by an intra-rectal administration of TNBS [15 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg)] in 33 Sprague-Dawley rats. Intracolonic pressure was regularly assessed during the 9 wk-experiment (weeks 0, 3, 5, and 7) in animals receiving CG (<i>n</i> = 14) at a human equivalent dose (HED) of 1.5 g/d or 3.0 g/d and compared to negative control (tap water, <i>n</i> = 11) and positive control (phloroglucinol at 1.5 g/d HED, <i>n</i> = 8) groups. The anti-inflammatory effect of CG was evaluated using clinical and histological scores in 30 C57bl6 male mice with colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) administered in their drinking water during 14 d. HT-29 cells under basal conditions and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were treated with CG to evaluate changes in pathways related to analgesia (\u00b5-opioid receptor (MOR), cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, inflammation [interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1b, and IL-8] and barrier function [mucin 2-5AC, claudin-2, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2] using the real-time PCR method. Molecular modelling of CG, LPS, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and phospholipomannan (PLM) was developed, and the ability of CG to chelate microbial pathogenic lipids was evaluated by docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Data were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Daily CG orally-administered to rats or mice was well tolerated without including diarrhea, visceral hypersensitivity, or inflammation, as evaluated at histological and molecular levels. In a model of CRD, CG at a dosage of 3 g/d HED significantly decreased visceral pain perception by 14% after 2 wk of administration (<i>P</i> < 0.01) and reduced inflammation intensity by 50%, resulting in complete regeneration of the colonic mucosa in mice with DSS-induced colitis. To better reproduce the characteristics of visceral pain in patients with IBS, we then measured the therapeutic impact of CG in rats with TNBS-induced inflammation to long-lasting visceral hypersensitivity. CG at a dosage of 1.5 g/d HED decreased visceral pain perception by 20% five weeks after colitis induction (<i>P</i> < 0.01). When the CG dosage was increased to 3.0 g/d HED, this analgesic effect surpassed that of the spasmolytic agent phloroglucinol, manifesting more rapidly within 3 wk and leading to a 50% inhibition of pain perception (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). The underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of CG involved, at least in part, a significant induction of MOR, CB2 receptor, and IL-10, as well as a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-8. CG also significantly upregulated barrier-related genes including muc5AC, claudin-2, and ZO-2. Molecular modelling of CG revealed a new property of the molecule as a chelator of microbial pathogenic lipids, sequestering gram-negative LPS and gram-positive LTA bacterial toxins, as well as PLM in fungi at the lowesr energy conformations. CG decreased visceral perception and intestinal inflammation through master gene regulation and direct binding of microbial products, suggesting that CG may constitute a new therapeutic strategy for patients with IBS or IBS-like symptoms.",

        "Title": "Screening of probiotic strains to improve visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome by using in vitro and in vivo approaches.",
        "Abstract": "Oral administration of probiotics has been proposed as a promising biotherapy to prevent and treat different diseases related to gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Due to the increasing research area on the characterisation of new probiotic bacterial strains, it is necessary to perform suitable in vitro experiments, using pertinent cellular models, in order to establish appropriate readout profiles based on IBS symptoms and subtypes. In this work, a collection of 30 candidate strains, belonging mainly to the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, were screened using three different sets of in vitro experiments with different readouts to identify promising probiotic strains with: (1) the ability to inhibit the synthesis of IL-8 production by TNF-\u03b1 stimulated HT-29 cells, (2) immunomodulatory properties quantified as increased IL-10 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs), and (3) the ability to maintain epithelial barrier integrity by increasing the trans-epithelial/endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) values in Caco-2 cells. Based on these criteria, three strains were selected: Lactobacillus gasseri PI41, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus PI48 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis PI50, and tested in a murine model of low-grade inflammation induced by dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS), which mimics some of the symptoms of IBS. Among the three strains, L. gasseri PI41 improved overall host well-being by preventing body weight loss in DNBS-treated mice and restored gut homeostasis by normalising the intestinal permeability and reducing pro-inflammatory markers. Therefore, the potential of this strain was confirmed in a second murine model known to reproduce IBS symptoms: the neonatal maternal separation (NMS) model. The PI41 strain was effective in preventing intestinal permeability and reducing colonic hypersensitivity. In conclusion, the set of in vitro experiments combined with in vivo assessments allowed us to identify a promising probiotic candidate strain, L. gasseri PI41, in the context of IBS.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic psychological stress develops and exacerbates irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) via activation of intestinal 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors involves impairment of intestinal functions. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ondansetron, a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, on locomotor activity, anxiety-related behaviors, and colonic functions in repeated water avoidance stress. Food intake and fecal pellet output (FPO) of sham stress (SS), water avoidance stress (WS), and water avoidance stress with oral administration of ondansetron (1\u00a0mg/kg BW) (WA) groups were monitored along the water avoidance stress protocol for 10 consecutive days. On day 11, locomotor activity and anxiety-related behaviors were determined using an open field test. Contractile properties of colonic tissues in response to KCl and a cumulative dose of carbachol (CCh) were determined using in vitro organ bath technique. FPO was significantly increased in the WS group after 7\u00a0days of water avoidance stress, which was reversed in WA group. WS group decreased unsupported rearing behavior compared to WS group, which was not altered in the WA group. The colon of the WS group had a higher tonic contraction in response to CCh than the SS and WA groups, which was reversed with ondansetron pre-incubation. Oral administration of ondansetron prevented increased FPO but did not affect anxiety-related behavior in repeated stress model. Colonic hypercontractility in the stressed mice was related to increased responses to cholinergic-induced contractions, which involved 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors. Our findings suggest the modulatory roles of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors to mediate stress-induced colonic dysfunction.",

Moringa isothiocyanate-1 (MIC-1) has shown potential for DN management, however, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. This research intended to evaluate the impact and mechanism of MIC-1 on DN. Six C57BLKS/J-db/m mice served as controls. Eighteen C57BLKS/J-db/db mice were randomly separated into three groups: db/db, db/db + irbesartan (IBS), and db/db + MIC-1. Three weeks post-drug administration, the body weight and kidney weight of mice in each group were measured. Concurrently, serum creatinine (Scr), urine albumin, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb), oxidative stress-, and inflammatory-related factors were determined. Additionally, the pathological injury, apoptosis, apoptosis-related markers, NLRP3, and ASC levels in the kidney tissues were examined utilizing H&E, Masson, PAS, TUNEL staining, and Western blot. MIC-1 decreased the body weight, kidney weight, the levels of Glu, Scr, and urine albumin in db/db mice. Moreover, MIC-1 significantly suppressed the levels of MDA, insulin, GHb, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, while increased the activities of SOD, CAT, and GPX in the serum of db/db mice. MIC-1 also mitigated the kidney tissue injury in db/db mice. Western blot assay showed that MIC-1 enhanced the Bcl-2 level and suppressed the Bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 levels of the kidney tissues in db/db mice. MIC-1 ameliorated the kidney injury in DN mice, and its mechanism may be associated with the suppression of renal cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses.",

Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect the expression of Mucin 2 (MUC2) and Occludin in the colon. Western blotting was used to detect changes in proteins related to tight junction (TJ), autophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the colon. Finally, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to monitor the alteration of gut microbiota after SSW treatment. Our study revealed that SSW administration resulted in reduced visceral sensitivity, improved defecation parameters, decreased intestinal transport velocity, and reduced intestinal permeability in IBS-D mice. Furthermore, SSW promotes the secretion of colonic mucus by enhancing autophagy and inhibiting ER stress. SSW treatment caused remodeling of the gut microbiome by increasing the abundance of Blautia, Muribaculum and Ruminococcus torques group. SSW can improve intestinal barrier function by promoting autophagy and inhibiting ER stress, thus exerting a therapeutic effect on IBS-D.",

        "Abstract": "Conventional power-integrated wireless neural recording devices suffer from bulky, rigid batteries in head-mounted configurations, hindering the precise interpretation of the subject's natural behaviors. These power sources also pose risks of material leakage and overheating. We present the direct printing of a power-integrated wireless neural recording system that seamlessly conforms to the cranium. A quasi-solid-state Zn-ion microbattery was 3D-printed as a built-in power source geometrically synchronized to the shape of a mouse skull. Soft deep-brain neural probes, interconnections, and auxiliary electronics were also printed using liquid metals on the cranium with high resolutions. In vivo studies using mice demonstrated the reliability and biocompatibility of this wireless neural recording system, enabling the monitoring of neural activities across extensive brain regions without notable heat generation. This all-printed neural interface system revolutionizes brain research, providing bio-conformable, customizable configurations for improved data quality and naturalistic experimentation.",

        "Title": "Regulation of the MCHergic Neural Circuit to Dorsal Raphe Nucleus on Emotion-Related Behaviors and Intestinal Dysfunction in Mice Model of Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Diarrhea.",
        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is frequently accompanied by depression and anxiety, resulting in a reduced quality of life and increased medical expenditures. Although psychological factors are known to play an important role in the genesis and development of IBS-D, an understanding of the central neural control of intestinal dysfunction remains elusive. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a gut-brain peptide involved in regulating feeding, sleep-wake rhythms, and emotional states. This study investigated the regulation of the MCHergic neural circuit from the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, intestinal motility, and visceral hypersensitivity in a mice model of IBS-D. The models of IBS-D were prepared by inducing chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Chemogenetic activation of the MCH neurons in the LHA could excite serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the DRN and induce anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and IBS-D-like symptoms, which could be recovered by microinjection of the MCH receptor antagonist SNAP94847 into the DRN. The mice model of IBS-D showed a reduction of 5-HT and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the DRN, while an elevation of 5-HT and BDNF was observed in the colon through immunofluorescent staining, ELISA, and western blot analysis. SNAP94847 treatment in the DRN alleviated anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, improved intestinal motility, and alleviated visceral hypersensitivity responses by normalizing the 5-HT and BDNF expression in the DRN and colon. This study suggests that the activation of MCH neurons in the LHA may induce IBS-D symptoms via the DRN and that the MCH receptor antagonist could potentially have therapeutic effects.",

        "Abstract": "In the US, Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) is the 8th leading cause of hospital readmission and 7th for mortality among all gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Here, we investigated GI dysfunction post-CDI in humans and mice post-acute infection. From March 2020 to July 2021, we reviewed the clinical records of 67 patients referred to the UVA Complicated C. difficile clinic for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) eligibility. C57BL/6 mice were infected with C. difficile and clinical scores were determined daily. Stool samples from mice were collected to measure the shedding of C. difficile and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels. On day 21 post-infection, Evans's blue and FITC-70kDa methods were performed to evaluate GI motility in mice. Of the 67 patients evaluated at the C. difficile clinic, 40 patients (59.7%) were confirmed to have CDI, and 22 patients (32.8%) with post-CDI IBS (diarrhea-type, constipation-type, and mixed-type). In infected mice, levels of MPO in stools and clinical score were higher on day 3. On day 21, mice recovered from body weight loss induced by CDI, and fecal MPO was undetectable. The total GI transit time (TGITT) and FITC-70kDa levels on the proximal colon were increased in infected mice (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), suggesting a constipation phenotype post-acute phase of CDI. A positive correlation intestinal inflammation on day 3 and TGITT on day 21 was observed. In conclusion, post-infection intestinal dysfunction occurs in humans and mice post-CDI. Importantly, we have validated in the mouse model that CDI causes abnormal GI transit in the recovery phase of the disease, indicating the potential utility of the model in exploring the underlying mechanisms of post-infectious IBS in humans.",

Two previous studies on <i>Arid1b</i>-mutant mice with the same exon 5 deletion in different genetic backgrounds revealed distinct synaptic phenotypes underlying the behavioral abnormalities: The first paper reported decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) region of the heterozygous <i>Arid1b</i>-mutant (<i>Arid1b</i><sup>+/-</sup>) brain without changes in excitatory synaptic transmission. In the second paper, in contrast, we did not observe any inhibitory synaptic change in layer 5 mPFC pyramidal neurons, but instead saw decreased excitatory synaptic transmission in layer 2/3 mPFC pyramidal neurons without any inhibitory synaptic change. In the present report, we show that when we changed the genetic background of <i>Arid1b</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice from C57BL/6\u2009N to C57BL/6\u2009J, to mimic the mutant mice of the first paper, we observed both the decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission in layer 5 mPFC pyramidal neurons reported in the first paper, and the decreased excitatory synaptic transmission in mPFC layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons reported in the second paper.

        "Abstract": "Andersen-Tawil syndrome type 1 is a rare heritable disease caused by mutations in the gene coding the strong inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel Kir2.1. The extracellular Cys (cysteine)<sub>122</sub>-to-Cys<sub>154</sub> disulfide bond in the channel structure is crucial for proper folding but has not been associated with correct channel function at the membrane. We evaluated whether a human mutation at the Cys<sub>122</sub>-to-Cys<sub>154</sub> disulfide bridge leads to Kir2.1 channel dysfunction and arrhythmias by reorganizing the overall Kir2.1 channel structure and destabilizing its open state. We identified a Kir2.1 loss-of-function mutation (c.366 A>T; p.Cys122Tyr) in an ATS1 family. To investigate its pathophysiological implications, we generated an AAV9-mediated cardiac-specific mouse model expressing the Kir2.1<sup>C122Y</sup> variant. We employed a multidisciplinary approach, integrating patch clamping and intracardiac stimulation, molecular biology techniques, molecular dynamics, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments. Kir2.1<sup>C122Y</sup> mice recapitulated the ECG features of ATS1 independently of sex, including corrected QT prolongation, conduction defects, and increased arrhythmia susceptibility. Isolated Kir2.1<sup>C122Y</sup> cardiomyocytes showed significantly reduced inwardly rectifier K+ (I<sub>K1</sub>) and inward Na+ (I<sub>Na</sub>) current densities independently of normal trafficking. Molecular dynamics predicted that the C122Y mutation provoked a conformational change over the 2000-ns simulation, characterized by a greater loss of hydrogen bonds between Kir2.1 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate than wild type (WT). Therefore, the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-binding pocket was destabilized, resulting in a lower conductance state compared with WT. Accordingly, on inside-out patch clamping, the C122Y mutation significantly blunted Kir2.1 sensitivity to increasing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate concentrations. In addition, the Kir2.1<sup>C122Y</sup> mutation resulted in channelosome degradation, demonstrating temporal instability of both Kir2.1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 proteins. The extracellular Cys<sub>122</sub>-to-Cys<sub>154</sub> disulfide bond in the tridimensional Kir2.1 channel structure is essential for the channel function. We demonstrate that breaking disulfide bonds in the extracellular domain disrupts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-dependent regulation, leading to channel dysfunction and defects in Kir2.1 energetic stability. The mutation also alters functional expression of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 channel and ultimately leads to conduction disturbances and life-threatening arrhythmia characteristic of Andersen-Tawil syndrome type 1.",

        "Abstract": "Toxoplasmosis continues to be a prevalent parasitic zoonosis with a global distribution. This disease is caused by an intracellular parasite known as <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, and the development of effective novel drug targets to combat it is imperative. There is limited information available on the potential advantages of wheat germ oil (WGO) and propolis, both individually and in combination, against the acute phase of toxoplasmosis. In this study, acute toxoplasmosis was induced in Swiss albino mice, followed by the treatment of infected animals with WGO and propolis, either separately or in combination. After 10\u2009days of experimental infection and treatment, mice from all groups were sacrificed, and their brains, uteri, and kidneys were excised for histopathological assessment. Additionally, the average parasite load in the brain was determined through parasitological assessment, and quantification of the parasite was performed using Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction targeting gene amplification. Remarkably, the study found that treating infected animals with wheat germ oil and propolis significantly reduced the parasite load compared to the control group that was infected but not treated. Moreover, the group treated with a combination of wheat germ oil and propolis exhibited a markedly greater reduction in parasitic load compared to the other groups. Similarly, the combination treatment effectively restored the histopathological changes observed in the brain, uterus, and kidney, and the scoring of these reported lesions confirmed these findings. In summary, the present results reveal intriguing insights into the potential therapeutic benefits of wheat germ oil and propolis in the treatment of acute toxoplasmosis.",

        "Abstract": "Microglial neuroinflammation appears to be neuroprotective in the early pathological stage, yet neurotoxic, which often precedes neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unclear how the microglial activities transit to the neurotoxic state during AD progression, due to complex neuron-glia interactions. Here, the mechanism of detrimental microgliosis in AD by employing 3D human AD mini-brains, brain tissues of AD patients, and 5XFAD mice is explored. In the human and animal AD models, amyloid-beta (A\u03b2)-overexpressing neurons and reactive astrocytes produce interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) and excessive oxidative stress. IFN\u03b3 results in the downregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the upregulation of Kelch-like ECH-associated Protein 1 (Keap1) in microglia, which inactivate nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and sensitize microglia to the oxidative stress and induces a proinflammatory microglia via nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB)-axis. The proinflammatory microglia in turn produce neurotoxic nitric oxide and proinflammatory mediators exacerbating synaptic impairment, phosphorylated-tau accumulation, and discernable neuronal loss. Interestingly, recovering Nrf2 in the microglia prevents the activation of proinflammatory microglia and significantly blocks the tauopathy in AD minibrains. Taken together, it is envisioned that IFN\u03b3-driven Nrf2 downregulation in microglia as a key target to ameliorate AD pathology.",

This study explored the potential exacerbation of AD by gut inflammation and microbial imbalances using an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) mouse model. Chronic gut inflammation was induced in the model by intrarectal injection of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), followed by a 4-week development period. We noted significant upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in the colon and evident gut microbial dysbiosis in the IBS mice. Additionally, these mice exhibited impaired gut barrier function, increased permeability, and elevated systemic inflammation markers such as IL-6 and LPS. A subsequent MC903 challenge on the right cheek lasting for 7 days revealed more severe AD symptoms in IBS mice compared to controls. Further, fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) from IBS mice resulted in aggravated AD symptoms, a result similarly observed with FMT from an IBS patient. Notably, an increased abundance of <i>Alistipes</i> in the feces of IBS mice correlated with heightened systemic and localized inflammation in both the gut and skin. These findings collectively indicate that chronic gut inflammation and microbial dysbiosis in IBS are critical factors exacerbating AD, highlighting the integral relationship between gut and skin health.",

Mouse models are widely used in brain research, often under anesthesia, which can affect vascular physiology. However, the impact of anesthesia on regional cerebral blood volume and flow in mice has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we have developed a whole-brain perfusion MRI approach by using a 5-second nitrogen gas stimulus under inhalational anesthetics to induce transient BOLD dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC). This method proved to be highly sensitive, repeatable within each imaging session, and across four weekly sessions. Relative cerebral blood volumes measured by BOLD DSC agree well with those by contrast agents. Quantitative cerebral blood volume and flow metrics were successfully measured in mice under dexmedetomidine and various isoflurane doses using both total vasculature-sensitive gradient-echo and microvasculature-sensitive spin-echo BOLD MRI. Dexmedetomidine reduces cerebral perfusion, while isoflurane increases cerebral perfusion in a dose-dependent manner.",

Therefore, safer and more effective approaches are urgently needed. We investigated the effects of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) in a mouse model of IBS-C. In the current study, C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into normal control, IBS-C model control, sham-electrostimulation (sham-ES), taVNS, and drug treatment groups. The effects of taVNS on fecal pellet number, fecal water content, and gastrointestinal transit were evaluated in IBS-C model mice. We assessed the effect of taVNS on visceral hypersensitivity using the colorectal distention test. 16S rRNA sequencing was used to analyze the fecal microbiota of the experimental groups. First, we found that taVNS increased fecal pellet number, fecal water content, and gastrointestinal transit in IBS-C model mice compared with the sham-ES group. Second, taVNS significantly decreased the abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) score compared with the sham-ES group, thus relieving visceral hyperalgesia. Third, the gut microbiota outcomes showed that taVNS restored Lactobacillus abundance while increasing Bifidobacterium probiotic abundance at the genus level. Notably, taVNS increased the number of c-kit-positive interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) in the myenteric plexus region in IBS-C mice compared with the sham-ES group. Therefore, our study indicated that taVNS effectively ameliorated IBS-C in the gut microbiota and ICC.",

        "Abstract": "A cell's ability to secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) for communication is present in all three domains of life. Notably, Gram-negative bacteria produce a specific type of EVs called outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). We previously observed the presence of OMVs in human blood, which could represent a means of communication from the microbiota to the host. Here, in order to investigate the possible translocation of OMVs from the intestine to other organs, the mouse was used as an animal model after OMVs administration. To achieve this, we first optimized the signal of OMVs containing the fluorescent protein miRFP713 associated with the outer membrane anchoring peptide OmpA by adding biliverdin, a fluorescence cofactor, to the cultures. The miRFP713-expressing OMVs produced in <i>E. coli</i> REL606 strain were then characterized according to their diameter and protein composition. Native- and miRFP713-expressing OMVs were found to produce homogenous populations of vesicles. Finally, in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence imaging was used to monitor the distribution of miRFP713-OMVs in mice in various organs whether by intravenous injection or oral gavage. The relative stability of the fluorescence signals up to 3 days post-injection/gavage paves the way to future studies investigating the OMV-based communication established between the different microbiotas and their host.",

        "Abstract": "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) comprise the largest group of gut microbial fermentation products. While absorption of most nutrients occurs in the small intestine, indigestible dietary components, such as fiber, reach the colon and are processed by the gut microbiome to produce a wide array of metabolites that influence host physiology. Numerous studies have implicated SCFAs as key modulators of host health, such as in regulating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, robust methods are still required for their detection and quantitation to meet the demands of biological studies probing the complex interplay of the gut-host-health paradigm. In this study, a sensitive, rapid-throughput, and readily expandible UHPLC-QqQ-MS platform using 2-PA derivatization was developed for the quantitation of gut-microbially derived SCFAs, related metabolites, and isotopically labeled homologues. The utility of this platform was then demonstrated by investigating the production of SCFAs in cecal contents from mice feeding studies, human fecal bioreactors, and fecal/bacterial fermentations of isotopically labeled dietary carbohydrates. Overall, the workflow proposed in this study serves as an invaluable tool for the rapidly expanding gut-microbiome and precision nutrition research field.",

        "Abstract": "Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) is a transcriptional regulator conventionally associated with immunomodulation. Recent molecular analyses mapping DNA binding sites of IRF1 have suggested its potential function in DNA repair. However, the physiologic significance of this noncanonical function remains unexplored. Here, we investigated the role of IRF1 in osteoarthritis (OA), a condition marked by senescence and chronic joint inflammation. OA progression was examined in wild-type and Irf1<sup>-/-</sup> mice using histologic assessments and microcomputed tomography analysis of whole-joint OA manifestations and behavioral assessments of joint pain. An integrated analysis of assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing and whole transcriptome data was conducted for the functional assessment of IRF1 in chondrocytes. The role of IRF1 in DNA repair and senescence was investigated by assaying \u03b3-H2AX foci and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. Our genome-wide investigation of IRF1 footprinting in chondrocytes revealed its primary occupancies in the promoters of DNA repair genes without noticeable footprint patterns in those of interferon-responsive genes. Chondrocytes lacking IRF1 accumulated irreversible DNA damage under oxidative stress, facilitating their entry into cellular senescence. IRF1 was down-regulated in the cartilage of human and mouse OA. Although IRF1 overexpression did not elicit an inflammatory response in joints or affect OA development, genetic deletion of Irf1 caused enhanced chondrocyte senescence and exacerbated post-traumatic OA in mice. IRF1 offers DNA damage surveillance in chondrocytes, protecting them from oxidative stress associated with OA risk factors. Our study provides a crucial and cautionary perspective that compromising IRF1 activity renders chondrocytes vulnerable to cellular senescence and promotes OA development.",

        "Abstract": "The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a bidirectional signaling channel that facilitates communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. Recent research on the gut-brain axis demonstrates that this connection enables the brain to influence gut function, which in turn influences the brain and its cognitive functioning. It is well established that malfunctioning of this axis adversely affects both systems' ability to operate effectively. Dysfunctions in the GBA have been associated with disorders of gut motility and permeability, intestinal inflammation, indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, IBS, and IBD, as well as neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders like depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Multiple research initiatives have shown that the gut microbiota, in particular, plays a crucial role in the GBA by participating in the regulation of a number of key neurochemicals that are known to have significant effects on the mental and physical well-being of an individual. Several studies have investigated the relationship between neuropsychiatric disorders and imbalances or disturbances in the metabolism of neurochemicals, often leading to concomitant gastrointestinal issues and modifications in gut flora composition. The interaction between neurological diseases and gut microbiota has been a focal point within this research. The novel therapeutic interventions in neuropsychiatric conditions involving interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary modifications are outlined in this review. The findings of multiple studies carried out on mice show that modulating and monitoring gut microbiota can help treat symptoms of such diseases, which raises the possibility of the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and even dietary changes as part of a new treatment strategy for neuropsychiatric disorders and their symptoms. The bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain through the gut-brain axis has revealed profound implications for both gastrointestinal and neurological health. Malfunctions in this axis have been connected to a range of disorders affecting gut function as well as cognitive and neuropsychiatric well-being. The emerging understanding of the role of gut microbiota in regulating key neurochemicals opens up possibilities for novel treatment approaches for conditions like depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Ginsenoside F2 (GF2), the protopanaxadiol-type constituent in <i>Panax ginseng</i>, has been reported to attenuate metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, the mechanism of action is not fully understood. Here, this study investigates the molecular mechanism by which GF2 regulates MASLD progression through liver X receptor (LXR). To demonstrate the effect of GF2 on LXR activity, computational modeling of protein-ligand binding, Time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay for LXR cofactor recruitment, and luciferase reporter assay were performed. LXR agonist T0901317 was used for LXR activation in hepatocytes and macrophages. MASLD was induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding with or without GF2 administration in WT and LXR\u03b1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Computational modeling showed that GF2 had a high affinity with LXR\u03b1. LXRE-luciferase reporter assay with amino acid substitution at the predicted ligand binding site revealed that the S264 residue of LXR\u03b1 was the crucial interaction site of GF2. TR-FRET assay demonstrated that GF2 suppressed LXR\u03b1 activity by favoring the binding of corepressors to LXR\u03b1 while inhibiting the accessibility of coactivators. <i>In vitro</i>, GF2 treatments reduced T0901317-induced fat accumulation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in hepatocytes and macrophages, respectively. Consistently, GF2 administration ameliorated hepatic steatohepatitis and improved glucose or insulin tolerance in WT but not in LXR\u03b1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. GF2 alters the binding affinities of LXR\u03b1 coregulators, thereby interrupting hepatic steatosis and inflammation in macrophages. Therefore, we propose that GF2 might be a potential therapeutic agent for the intervention in patients with MASLD.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the loss of memory due to aggregation of misphosphorylated tau and amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques in the brain, elevated release of inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and reactive oxygen species from astrocytes, and subsequent neurodegeneration. Recently, it was found that enzyme Ornithine Decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) acts as a bridge between the astrocytic urea cycle and the putrescine-to-GABA conversion pathway in the brain of AD mouse models as well as human patients. In this study, we show that the long-term knockdown of astrocytic Odc1 in APP/PS1 animals was sufficient to completely clear A\u03b2 plaques in the hippocampus while simultaneously switching the astrocytes from a detrimental reactive state to a regenerative active state, characterized by proBDNF expression. Our experiments also reveal an effect of astrocytic ODC1 inhibition on the expression of genes involved in synapse pruning and organization, histone modification, apoptotic signaling and protein processing. These genes are previously known to be associated with astrocytic activation and together create a neuroregeneration-supportive environment in the brain. By inhibiting ODC1 for a long period of 3\u00a0months in AD mice, we demonstrate that the beneficial amyloid-clearing process of astrocytes can be completely segregated from the systemically harmful astrocytic response to insult. Our study reports an almost complete clearance of A\u03b2 plaques by controlling an endogenous degradation process, which also modifies the astrocytic state to create a regeneration-supportive environment in the brain. These findings present the potential of modulating astrocytic clearance of A\u03b2 as a powerful therapeutic strategy against AD.",

        "Abstract": "Implantable neural probes have been extensively utilized in the fields of neurocircuitry, systems neuroscience, and brain-computer interface. However, the long-term functionality of these devices is hampered by the formation of glial scar and astrogliosis at the surface of electrodes. In this study, we administered KDS2010, a recently developed reversible MAO-B inhibitor, to mice through ad libitum drinking in order to prevent glial scar formation and astrogliosis. The administration of KDS2010 allowed long-term recordings of neural signals with implantable devices, which remained stable over a period of 6\u2009months and even restored diminished neural signals after probe implantation. KDS2010 effectively prevented the formation of glial scar, which consists of reactive astrocytes and activated microglia around the implant. Furthermore, it restored neural activity by disinhibiting astrocytic MAO-B dependent tonic GABA inhibition induced by astrogliosis. We suggest that the use of KDS2010 is a promising approach to prevent glial scar formation around the implant, thereby enabling long-term functionality of neural devices.",

        "Abstract": "The \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR) is a class of opioid receptors characterized by a high affinity for \u03b2-endorphin and morphine. MOR is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a role in reward and analgesic effects. While expression of MOR has been well established in neurons and microglia, astrocytic MOR expression has been less clear. Recently, we have reported that MOR is expressed in hippocampal astrocytes, and its activation has a critical role in the establishment of conditioned place preference. Despite this critical role, the expression and function of astrocytic MOR from other brain regions are still unknown. Here, we report that MOR is significantly expressed in astrocytes and GABAergic neurons from various brain regions including the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, periaqueductal gray, amygdala, and arcuate nucleus. Using the MOR-mCherry reporter mice and Imaris analysis, we demonstrate that astrocytic MOR expression exceeded 60% in all tested regions. Also, we observed similar MOR expression of GABAergic neurons as shown in the previous distribution studies and it is noteworthy that MOR expression is particularly in parvalbumin (PV)-positive neurons. Furthermore, consistent with the normal MOR function observed in the MOR-mCherry mouse, our study also demonstrates intact MOR functionality in astrocytes through iGluSnFr-mediated glutamate imaging. Finally, we show the sex-difference in the expression pattern of MOR in PV-positive neurons, but not in the GABAergic neurons and astrocytes. Taken together, our findings highlight a substantial astrocytic MOR presence across various brain regions.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic abdominal pain in the absence of ongoing disease is the hallmark of disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs), including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). While the etiology of DGBIs remains poorly understood, there is evidence that both genetic and environmental factors play a role. In this study, we report the identification and validation of <i>Avpr1a</i> as a novel candidate gene for visceral hypersensitivity (VH), a primary peripheral mechanism underlying abdominal pain in DGBI/IBS. Comparing two C57BL/6 (BL/6) substrains (C57BL/6NTac and C57BL/6J) revealed differential susceptibility to the development of chronic VH following intrarectal zymosan (ZYM) instillation, a validated preclinical model for post-inflammatory IBS. Using whole genome sequencing, we identified a SNP differentiating the two strains in the 5' intergenic region upstream of <i>Avpr1a</i>, encoding the protein arginine-vasopressin receptor 1A (AVPR1A). We used behavioral, histological, and molecular approaches to identify distal colon-specific gene expression differences and neuronal hyperresponsiveness covarying with <i>Avpr1a</i> genotype and VH susceptibility. While the two BL/6 substrains did not differ across other gastrointestinal (GI) phenotypes (e.g., GI motility), VH-susceptible BL/6NTac mice had higher colonic <i>Avpr1a</i> mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, neurons of the enteric nervous system were hyperresponsive to the AVPR1A agonist AVP, suggesting a role for enteric neurons in the pathology underlying VH. These results parallel our findings that patients' colonic <i>Avpr1a</i> mRNA expression was higher in patients with higher pain ratings. Taken together, these findings implicate differential regulation of <i>Avpr1a</i> as a novel mechanism of VH-susceptibility as well as a potential therapeutic target specific to VH.",

Therefore, T5-CLP constitutes a unique DNA-free bacteriophage capsid able to display a regular array of large antigens through highly efficient chemical-free anchoring.

        "Abstract": "Gut - brain communications disorders in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are associated with intestinal microbiota composition, increased gut permeability, and psychosocial disturbances. Symptoms of IBS are difficult to medicate, and hence much research is being made into alternative approaches. This study assesses the potential of a treatment with pasteurized Akkermansia muciniphila for alleviating IBS-like symptoms in two mouse models of IBS with different etiologies. Two clinically relevant animal models were used to mimic IBS-like symptoms in C57BL6/J mice: the neonatal maternal separation (NMS) paradigm and the Citrobacter rodentium infection model. In both models, gut permeability, colonic sensitivity, fecal microbiota composition and colonic IL-22 expression were evaluated. The cognitive performance and emotional state of the animals were also assessed by several tests in the C. rodentium infection model. The neuromodulation ability of pasteurized A. muciniphila was assessed on primary neuronal cells from mice dorsal root ganglia using a ratiometric calcium imaging approach. The administration of pasteurized A. muciniphila significantly reduced colonic hypersensitivity in both IBS mouse models, accompanied by a reinforcement of the intestinal barrier function. Beneficial effects of pasteurized A. muciniphila treatment have also been observed on anxiety-like behavior and memory defects in the C. rodentium infection model. Finally, a neuroinhibitory effect exerted by pasteurized A. muciniphila was observed on neuronal cells stimulated with two algogenic substances such as capsaicin and inflammatory soup. Our findings demonstrate novel anti-hyperalgesic and neuroinhibitory properties of pasteurized A. muciniphila, which therefore may have beneficial effects in relieving pain and anxiety in subjects with IBS.",

Although MCCs have shared functions to control fluid flow via coordinated motility of multiple ciliary structures, they are found in multiple mammalian tissues originating from distinct germ layers and differentiate via distinct developmental pathways. To understand the similarities and differences of MCCs in multiple tissues, we investigated single-cell transcriptome data of nasal epithelial cells, bronchial tubes, fallopian tubes, and ependymal cells in the subventricular zone from humans and mice by cross-species data integration. Expression of cilia-associated genes was indistinguishable between these MCCs, although cell populations had unique properties by the species and tissue, demonstrating that they share the same final differentiation status for ciliary functions. We further analyzed the final differentiation step of MCCs from their distinctive progenitors and confirmed their convergent gene set expression for ciliogenesis at the final step. These results may provide new insight into understanding ciliogenesis during the developmental process.",

        "Abstract": "Aberrant serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) metabolism and neurite outgrowth were associated with abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We previously demonstrated that 5-HT receptor subtype 7 (5-HT\u2087) was involved in visceral hypersensitivity of IBS-like mouse models. The aim was to compare the analgesic effects of a novel 5-HT\u2087 antagonist to reference standards in mouse models and investigate the mechanisms of 5-HT\u2087-dependent neuroplasticity. Two mouse models, including Giardia post-infection combined with water avoidance stress (GW) and post-resolution of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis (PT) were used. Mice were orally administered CYY1005 (CYY, a novel 5-HT\u2087 antagonist), alosetron (ALN, a 5-HT\u2083 antagonist), and loperamide (LPM, an opioid receptor agonist) prior to measurement of visceromotor responses (VMR). Levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin receptors (NTRs) were assessed. Peroral CYY was more potent than ALN or LPM in reducing VMR values in GW and PT mice. Increased mucosal 5-HT\u2087-expressing nerve fibers were associated with elevated Gap43 levels in the mouse colon. We observed higher colonic Ntrk2 and Ngfr expression in GW mice, and increased Bdnf expression in PT mice compared with control mice. Human SH-SY5Y cells stimulated with mouse colonic supernatant or exogenous serotonin exhibited longer nerve fibers, which CYY dose-dependently inhibited. Serotonin increased Ntrk1 and Ngfr expression via 5-HT\u2087 but not 5-HT\u2083 or 5-HT\u2084, while Ntrk2 upregulation was dependent on all three 5-HT receptor subtypes. Stronger analgesic effects by peroral CYY were observed compared with reference standards in two IBS-like mouse models. The 5-HT\u2087-dependent NTR upregulation and neurite elongation may be involved in intestinal hypernociception.",

However, its relation with tau pathology (i.e., aberrant tau protein behavior in tauopathies such as AD) has been inconclusive. This study investigated the interaction between a high-fat diet (HFD) and tau pathology in adult male mice. Transgenic mice overexpressing human P301S Tau (those with the pathology) and wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to behavioral tests, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and western blotting analysis to investigate the effects of prolonged HFD versus regular diet during adulthood. HFD increased body weight in both WT and P301S mice but had minimal effect on blood glucose levels. The brain response to HFD was tau genotype-specific. WT mice exhibited decreased recognition memory and enhanced network connectivity in fMRI, while P301S mice exhibited white matter tract disorganization in DTI as the sole significant finding. The reduction of insulin receptor \u03b2, insulin downstream signaling, neuronal nuclear protein, CD68-positive phagocytic activity, and myelin basic protein level were confined to the cortex of WT mice. In contrast to P301S mice, WT mice showed significant changes in the tau protein and its phosphorylation levels along with increased soluble neurofilament light levels in the hippocampus. HFD-induced brain dysfunction and pathological changes were blunted in mice with the pathology and more profound in healthy mice. Our findings highlight the need to consider this interaction between obesity and tau pathology when tailoring treatment strategies for AD and other tauopathies.",

Specifically, spatial memory (i.e., spatial navigation) is typically most efficient in men. This sexual dimorphism has been replicated in male rats but not clearly in mice. In this study, sex differences in spatial memory were assessed in thirty-six C57BL/6\u00a0J mice (Janvier Labs; i.e., C57BL/6JRj mice), a widely used mouse substrain. Both male and female mice (12 weeks-old) were subjected to standard behavioral paradigms: the elevated plus maze, the open field test, the novel object and place tests, the forced swimming test, and the water maze test for spatial navigation. Across assessment, no sex differences were found in measures of locomotor activity, emotional and behavioral responses, and object and place recognition memories. In the water maze, male mice were faster in learning the platform location in the reference memory training and used more spatial strategies during the first training days. However, both sexes reached a similar asymptotic performance and performed similarly in the probe trial for long-term memory consolidation. No sex differences were found in the cued training, platform inversion sessions, or spatial working memory sessions. Hippocampal expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor was similar in both sexes, either in basal conditions or after performing the behavioral training battery. Importantly, female mice were not more variable than males in any measure analyzed. This outcome encourages the investigation of sex differences in animal models and the usefulness of including female mice in behavioral research.",

Finally, Inf-aboveCC mice show lower fecal histidine and urocanate:histidine and urocanate:glutamate ratios in the perirhinal cortex compared to Inf-belowCC mice. Overall, these findings reveal a causative role of gut microbiota on infant cognition, pointing at the modulation of histidine metabolite levels as a potential underlying mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a specialized layer between blood vessels and tissue in the brain, which is comprised of a neuro-glia-vascular (NGV) unit, thus play a vital role in various brain diseases. We developed the in vitro NGV units by co-culturing brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs; bEnd.3) and primary neural stem cells extracted from subventricular zone of adult mice. This approach was designed to mimic the RNA profile conditions found in the microvessels of a mouse brain and confirmed through various comparative transcriptome analyses. Optimal NGV unit development was achieved by adjusting cell density-dependent co-culture ratios. Specifically, the morphogenic development and neuronal association of astrocyte endfeet were well observed in the contact region with BMECs in the NGV unit. Through transcriptome analysis, we compared co-cultured bEnd.3/NSCs with monocultured bEnd.3 or NSCs and additionally compared them with previously reported mouse brain vascular tissue to show that this NGV unit model is a suitable in vitro model for neurological disease such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This in vitro NGV unit was formed from neural stem cells and vascular cells in the brain of adult mice, not embryos. It is very useful for studying brain disease mechanisms by identifying proteins and genes associated with diseases progress. We suggest that this simple in vitro NGV model is appropriate to investigate the relationship between BBB changes and pathological factors in the fields of neurovascular biology and cerebrovascular diseases including AD.",

        "Abstract": "To thrive in complex environments, animals and artificial agents must learn to act adaptively to maximize fitness and rewards. Such adaptive behavior can be learned through reinforcement learning<sup>1</sup>, a class of algorithms that has been successful at training artificial agents<sup>2-6</sup> and at characterizing the firing of dopamine neurons in the midbrain<sup>7-9</sup>. In classical reinforcement learning, agents discount future rewards exponentially according to a single time scale, controlled by the discount factor. Here, we explore the presence of multiple timescales in biological reinforcement learning. We first show that reinforcement agents learning at a multitude of timescales possess distinct computational benefits. Next, we report that dopamine neurons in mice performing two behavioral tasks encode reward prediction error with a diversity of discount time constants. Our model explains the heterogeneity of temporal discounting in both cue-evoked transient responses and slower timescale fluctuations known as dopamine ramps. Crucially, the measured discount factor of individual neurons is correlated across the two tasks suggesting that it is a cell-specific property. Together, our results provide a new paradigm to understand functional heterogeneity in dopamine neurons, a mechanistic basis for the empirical observation that humans and animals use non-exponential discounts in many situations<sup>10-14</sup>, and open new avenues for the design of more efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.",

        "Abstract": "Rhabdomyolysis is a severe clinical syndrome associated to acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). TWEAK/Fn14 signaling axis regulates renal inflammation and tubular cell death. However, the functional role of TWEAK/Fn14 in rhabdomyolysis remains unknown. Rhabdomyolysis was induced in wild-type, TWEAK- and Fn14-deficient mice or mice treated with TWEAK blocking antibody. Renal injury, inflammation, fibrosis and cell death were assessed. Additionally, we performed in vivo and in vitro studies to explore the possible signalling pathways involved in Fn14 regulation. Fn14 renal expression was increased in mice with rhabdomyolysis, correlating with decline of renal function. Mechanistically, myoglobin (Mb) induced Fn14 expression via ERK and p38 pathway, whereas Nrf2 activation diminished Mb-mediated Fn14 upregulation in cultured renal cells. TWEAK or Fn14 genetic depletion ameliorated rhabdomyolysis-associated loss of renal function, histological damage, tubular cell death, inflammation, and expression of both tubular and endothelial injury markers. Deficiency of TWEAK or Fn14 also decreased long-term renal inflammation and fibrosis in mice with rhabdomyolysis. Finally, pharmacological treatment with a blocking TWEAK antibody diminished the expression of acute renal injury markers and cell death and lessened residual kidney fibrosis and chronic inflammation in rhabdomyolysis. TWEAK/Fn14 axis participates in the pathogenesis of rhabdomyolysis-AKI and subsequent AKI-CKD transition. Blockade of this signaling pathway may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for reducing rhabdomyolysis-mediated renal injury.

Our study was to investigate whether the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) projected to the insular cortex (IC) to regulate colorectal visceral pain in neonatal colonic inflammation (NCI) mice and underlying mechanisms. We applied optogenetic, chemogenetic, or pharmacological approaches to manipulate the glutamatergic<sup>PVT-IC</sup> pathway. Fiber photometry was used to assess neuronal activity. Electromyography activities in response to colorectal distension (CRD) were measured to evaluate the colorectal visceral pain. NCI enhanced c-Fos expression and calcium activity upon CRD in the IC<sup>Glu</sup>, and optogenetic manipulation of them altered colorectal visceral pain responses accordingly. Viral tracing indicated that the PVT<sup>Glu</sup> projected to the IC<sup>Glu</sup>. Optogenetic manipulation of PVT<sup>Glu</sup> changed colorectal visceral pain responses. Furthermore, selective optogenetic modulation of PVT projections in the IC influenced colorectal visceral pain, which was reversed by chemogenetic manipulation of downstream IC<sup>Glu</sup>.

        "Abstract": "Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody, cetuximab, therapy has significantly improved the clinical outcomes of patients with colorectal cancer, but the response to cetuximab can vary widely among individuals. We thus need strategies for predicting the response to this therapy. However, the current methods are unsatisfactory in their predictive power. Cetuximab can promote the internalization and degradation of EGFR, and its therapeutic efficacy is significantly correlated with the degree of EGFR degradation. Here, we present a new approach to predict the response to anti-EGFR therapy, cetuximab by evaluating the degree of EGFR internalization and degradation of colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Our newly developed fluorogenic cetuximab-conjugated probe (Cetux-probe) was confirmed to undergo EGFR binding, internalization, and lysosomal degradation to yield fluorescence activation; it thus shares the action mechanism by which cetuximab exerts its anti-tumor effects. Cetux-probe-activated fluorescence could be used to gauge EGFR degradation and showed a strong linear correlation with the cytotoxicity of cetuximab in colorectal cancer cells and tumor-bearing mice. The predictive ability of Cetux-probe-activated fluorescence was much higher than those of EGFR expression or KRAS mutation status. The Cetux-probes may become useful tools for predicting the response to cetuximab therapy by assessing EGFR degradation.",

        "Abstract": "Our objective was to investigate whether short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), specifically acetate and butyrate, could prevent vascular dysfunction and elevated blood pressure (BP) in mice with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) induced by TLR7 activation using imiquimod (IMQ). Treatment with both SCFAs and dietary fibers rich in resistant starch (RS) or inulin-type fructans (ITF) effectively prevented the development of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. Additionally, these treatments improved aortic relaxation induced by acetylcholine and mitigated vascular oxidative stress. Acetate and butyrate treatments also contributed to the maintenance of colonic integrity, reduced endotoxemia, and decreased the proportion of helper T (Th)17 cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), blood, and aorta in TLR7-induced SLE mice. The observed changes in MLNs were correlated with increased levels of GPR43 mRNA in mice treated with acetate and increased GPR41 levels along with decreased histone deacetylase (HDAC)-\u00a03 levels in mice treated with butyrate. Notably, the effects attributed to acetate, but not butyrate, were nullified when co-administered with the GPR43 antagonist GLPG-0974. T cell priming and differentiation into Th17 cells in MLNs, as well as increased Th17 cell infiltration, were linked to aortic endothelial dysfunction and hypertension subsequent to the transfer of faecal microbiota from IMQ-treated mice to germ-free (GF) mice. These effects were counteracted in GF mice through treatment with either acetate or butyrate. To conclude, these findings underscore the potential of SCFA consumption in averting hypertension by restoring balance to the interplay between the gut, immune system, and vascular wall in SLE induced by TLR7 activation.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic stress underlies the etiology of both major depressive disorder (MDD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), two highly prevalent and debilitating conditions with high rates of co-morbidity. However, it is not fully understood how the brain and gut bi-directionally communicate during stress to impact intestinal homeostasis and stress-relevant behaviours. Using the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model, we find that stressed mice display greater intestinal permeability and circulating levels of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) compared to unstressed control (CON) mice. Interestingly, the microbiota in the colon also exhibit elevated LPS biosynthesis gene expression following CSDS. Additionally, CSDS triggers an increase in pro-inflammatory colonic IFN\u03b3<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells and a decrease in IL4<sup>+</sup> Th2 cells compared to CON mice, and this gut inflammation contributes to stress-induced intestinal barrier permeability and social avoidance behaviour. We next investigated the role of enteric neurons and identified that noradrenergic dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH)<sup>+</sup> neurons in the colon are activated by CSDS, and that their ablation protects against gut pathophysiology and disturbances in social behaviour. Retrograde tracing from the colon identified a population of corticotropin-releasing hormone-expressing (CRH<sup>+</sup>) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) that innervate the colon and are activated by stress. Chemogenetically activating these PVH CRH<sup>+</sup> neurons is sufficient to induce gut inflammation, barrier permeability, and social avoidance behaviour, while inhibiting these cells prevents these effects following exposure to CSDS. Thus, we define a stress-activated brain-to-gut circuit that confers colonic inflammation, leading to impaired intestinal barrier function, and consequent behavioural deficits.",

        "Abstract": "Taiwaniaquinoids are a unique family of diterpenoids predominantly isolated from Taiwania cryptomerioides Hayata. Previously, we evaluated the antiproliferative effect of several synthetic taiwaniaquinoids against human lung (A-549), colon (T-84), and breast (MCF-7) tumor cell lines. Herein, we report the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of the most potent compounds. Their cytotoxic activity against healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has also been examined. We underscore the limited toxicity of compound C36 in PBMCs and demonstrate that it exerts its antitumor effect in MCF-7 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.8\u00a0\u00b5M) by triggering an increase in reactive oxygen species, increasing the cell population in the sub-G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle (90 %), and ultimately activating apoptotic (49.6 %) rather than autophagic processes. Western blot results suggested that the underlying mechanism of the C36 apoptotic effects was linked to caspase 9 activation and a rise in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In vivo analyses showed normal behavior and hematological parameters in C57BL/6 mice post C36 treatment. Moreover, no significant impact was observed on the biochemical parameters of these animals, indicating that C36 did not induce liver toxicity. Furthermore, C36 demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor growth in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice implanted with E0771 mouse mammary tumor cells, effectively improving survival rates. These findings position taiwaniaquinoids, particularly compound C36, as promising therapeutic candidates for human breast cancer.",

        "Abstract": "Translational regulation in tissue environments during in vivo viral pathogenesis has rarely been studied due to the lack of translatomes from virus-infected tissues, although a series of translatome studies using in vitro cultured cells with viral infection have been reported. In this study, we exploited tissue-optimized ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and severe-COVID-19 model mice to establish the first temporal translation profiles of virus and host genes in the lungs during SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Our datasets revealed not only previously unknown targets of translation regulation in infected tissues but also hitherto unreported molecular signatures that contribute to tissue pathology after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, we observed gradual increases in pseudoribosomal ribonucleoprotein (RNP) interactions that partially overlapped the trails of ribosomes, being likely involved in impeding translation elongation. Contemporaneously developed ribosome heterogeneity with predominantly dysregulated 5\u2009S rRNP association supported the malfunction of elongating ribosomes. Analyses of canonical Ribo-seq reads (ribosome footprints) highlighted two obstructive characteristics to host gene expression: ribosome stalling on codons within transmembrane domain-coding regions and compromised translation of immunity- and metabolism-related genes with upregulated transcription. Our findings collectively demonstrate that the abrogation of translation integrity may be one of the most critical factors contributing to pathogenesis after SARS-CoV-2 infection of tissues.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine neurons are essential for voluntary movement, reward learning, and motivation, and their dysfunction is closely linked to various psychological and neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, understanding the detailed signaling mechanisms that functionally modulate dopamine neurons is crucial for the development of better therapeutic strategies against dopamine-related disorders. Phospholipase C\u03b31 (PLC\u03b31) is a key enzyme in intracellular signaling that regulates diverse neuronal functions in the brain. It was proposed that PLC\u03b31 is implicated in the development of dopaminergic neurons, while the physiological function of PLC\u03b31 remains to be determined. In this study, we investigated the physiological role of PLC\u03b31, one of the key effector enzymes in intracellular signaling, in regulating dopaminergic function in vivo. We found that cell type-specific deletion of PLC\u03b31 does not adversely affect the development and cellular morphology of midbrain dopamine neurons but does facilitate dopamine release from dopaminergic axon terminals in the striatum. The enhancement of dopamine release was accompanied by increased colocalization of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) at dopaminergic axon terminals. Notably, dopamine neuron-specific knockout of PLC\u03b31 also led to heightened expression and colocalization of synapsin III, which controls the trafficking of synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, the knockdown of VMAT2 and synapsin III in dopamine neurons resulted in a significant attenuation of dopamine release, while this attenuation was less severe in PLC\u03b31 cKO mice. Our findings suggest that PLC\u03b31 in dopamine neurons could critically modulate dopamine release at axon terminals by directly or indirectly interacting with synaptic machinery, including VMAT2 and synapsin III.",

        "Title": "Chitin-glucan improves important pathophysiological features of irritable bowel syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most frequent and debilitating conditions leading to gastroenterological referrals. However, recommended treatments remain limited, yielding only limited therapeutic gains. Chitin-glucan (CG) is a novel dietary prebiotic classically used in humans at a dosage of 1.5-3.0 g/d and is considered a safe food ingredient by the European Food Safety Authority. To provide an alternative approach to managing patients with IBS, we performed preclinical molecular, cellular, and animal studies to evaluate the role of chitin-glucan in the main pathophysiological mechanisms involved in IBS. To evaluate the roles of CG in visceral analgesia, intestinal inflammation, barrier function, and to develop computational molecular models. Visceral pain was recorded through colorectal distension (CRD) in a model of long-lasting colon hypersensitivity induced by an intra-rectal administration of TNBS [15 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg)] in 33 Sprague-Dawley rats. Intracolonic pressure was regularly assessed during the 9 wk-experiment (weeks 0, 3, 5, and 7) in animals receiving CG (<i>n</i> = 14) at a human equivalent dose (HED) of 1.5 g/d or 3.0 g/d and compared to negative control (tap water, <i>n</i> = 11) and positive control (phloroglucinol at 1.5 g/d HED, <i>n</i> = 8) groups. The anti-inflammatory effect of CG was evaluated using clinical and histological scores in 30 C57bl6 male mice with colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) administered in their drinking water during 14 d. HT-29 cells under basal conditions and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were treated with CG to evaluate changes in pathways related to analgesia (\u00b5-opioid receptor (MOR), cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, inflammation [interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1b, and IL-8] and barrier function [mucin 2-5AC, claudin-2, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2] using the real-time PCR method. Molecular modelling of CG, LPS, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and phospholipomannan (PLM) was developed, and the ability of CG to chelate microbial pathogenic lipids was evaluated by docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Data were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Daily CG orally-administered to rats or mice was well tolerated without including diarrhea, visceral hypersensitivity, or inflammation, as evaluated at histological and molecular levels. In a model of CRD, CG at a dosage of 3 g/d HED significantly decreased visceral pain perception by 14% after 2 wk of administration (<i>P</i> < 0.01) and reduced inflammation intensity by 50%, resulting in complete regeneration of the colonic mucosa in mice with DSS-induced colitis. To better reproduce the characteristics of visceral pain in patients with IBS, we then measured the therapeutic impact of CG in rats with TNBS-induced inflammation to long-lasting visceral hypersensitivity. CG at a dosage of 1.5 g/d HED decreased visceral pain perception by 20% five weeks after colitis induction (<i>P</i> < 0.01). When the CG dosage was increased to 3.0 g/d HED, this analgesic effect surpassed that of the spasmolytic agent phloroglucinol, manifesting more rapidly within 3 wk and leading to a 50% inhibition of pain perception (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). The underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of CG involved, at least in part, a significant induction of MOR, CB2 receptor, and IL-10, as well as a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-8. CG also significantly upregulated barrier-related genes including muc5AC, claudin-2, and ZO-2. Molecular modelling of CG revealed a new property of the molecule as a chelator of microbial pathogenic lipids, sequestering gram-negative LPS and gram-positive LTA bacterial toxins, as well as PLM in fungi at the lowesr energy conformations. CG decreased visceral perception and intestinal inflammation through master gene regulation and direct binding of microbial products, suggesting that CG may constitute a new therapeutic strategy for patients with IBS or IBS-like symptoms.",

        "Title": "An Overview of the Effects of Tenapanor on Visceral Hypersensitivity in the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation.",
        "Abstract": "Patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) experience persistent abdominal pain, a common symptom leading to greater healthcare utilization and reports of treatment non-response. Clinically significant improvements in abdominal pain were observed in clinical trials of tenapanor, a first-in-class inhibitor of sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3), for the treatment of IBS-C in adults. This narrative review reports the current knowledge about visceral hypersensitivity as a mechanism for abdominal pain in patients with IBS-C and explores the published evidence for hypothesized mechanisms by which tenapanor may reduce visceral hypersensitivity leading to the observed clinical response of decreased abdominal pain. Abdominal pain is experienced through activation and signaling of nociceptive dorsal root ganglia that innervate the gut. These sensory afferent neurons may become hypersensitized through signaling of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), resulting in reduced action potential thresholds. TRPV1 signaling is also a key component of the proinflammatory cascade involving mast cell responses to macromolecule exposure following permeation through the intestinal epithelium. Indirect evidence of this pathway is supported by observations of higher pain in association with increased intestinal permeability in patients with IBS. Tenapanor reduces intestinal sodium absorption, leading to increased water retention in the intestinal lumen, thereby improving gastrointestinal motility. In animal models of visceral hypersensitivity, tenapanor normalized visceromotor responses and normalized TRPV1-mediated nociceptive signaling. By improving gastrointestinal motility, decreasing intestinal permeability and inflammation, and normalizing nociception through decreased TRPV1 signaling, tenapanor may reduce visceral hypersensitivity, leading to less abdominal pain in patients with IBS-C. Therapies that have demonstrated effects on visceral hypersensitivity may be the future direction for meaningful abdominal pain relief for patients with IBS-C.",

The symptoms of GI disorders are commonly considered to be triggered and exacerbated by fatty food intake. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the food preferences of patients with GI disorders. Methods Forty food images (including fatty and light foods) and 20 animal images were selected to evaluate food preferences. The preference score was assessed using a visual analog scale ranging from 1 to 100. GI symptoms were evaluated using the GI Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), and correlations between the GSRS and preference scores were investigated. Results Overall, 22 healthy controls and 23, 29, 27, and 20 patients with FD, IBS, GERD, and IBD, respectively, were enrolled. The preference score for all foods in patients with FD was significantly lower than that in healthy controls and those with IBS, GERD, and IBD (52.9 vs. 66.5 vs. 68.5 vs. 69.1 vs. 70.7, p<0.01). The score of fatty foods was lower in patients with FD than in healthy controls and those with IBS, GERD, and IBD (43.8 vs. 72.3 vs. 77.5 vs. 77.4 vs. 80.7, p<0.01), whereas that of light foods and animal images was not different among the groups. No significant correlation was found between the preference score and symptom severity. Conclusions Patients with FD had a negative preference for foods, particularly fatty foods, independent of the severity of GI symptoms.",

        "Abstract": "Tears have emerged as a promising alternative to blood for diagnosing diabetes. Despite increasing attempts to measure tear glucose using smart contact lenses, the controversy surrounding the correlation between tear glucose and blood glucose still limits the clinical usage of tears. Herein, we present an in-depth investigation of the correlation between tear glucose and blood glucose using a wireless and soft smart contact lens for continuous monitoring of tear glucose. This smart contact lens is capable of quantitatively monitoring the tear glucose levels in basal tears excluding the effect of reflex tears which might weaken the relationship with blood glucose. Furthermore, this smart contact lens can provide an unprecedented level of continuous tear glucose data acquisition at sub-minute intervals. These advantages allow the precise estimation of lag time, enabling the establishment of the concept called 'personalized lag time'. This demonstration considers individual differences and is successfully applied to both non-diabetic and diabetic humans, as well as in animal models, resulting in a high correlation.",

Instead, antibody discovery currently involves time-consuming immunization of an animal or library screening approaches. Here we demonstrate that a fine-tuned RFdiffusion network is capable of designing de novo antibody variable heavy chains (VHH's) that bind user-specified epitopes. We experimentally confirm binders to four disease-relevant epitopes, and the cryo-EM structure of a designed VHH bound to influenza hemagglutinin is nearly identical to the design model both in the configuration of the CDR loops and the overall binding pose.",

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of obesity increases alarmingly every year mostly due to external factors such as high-fat and high-refined sugar intake associated with a sedentary lifestyle. It triggers metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, hyperlipemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the beneficial effects of a combined intervention with caloric restriction, nutraceutical intake, and a mixed training protocol on oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut dysbiosis derived from the development of obesity in a C57BL6/J mouse experimental model of diet-induced obesity (4.6 Kcal/g diet, 45% Kcal as fat, and 20% fructose in the drinking fluid). The nutraceutical was formulated with ethanolic extracts of <i>Argania spinosa</i> pulp (10%) and <i>Camelina sativa</i> seeds (10%) and with protein hydrolysates from <i>Psoralea corylifolia</i> seeds (40%) and <i>Spirodela polyrhiza</i> whole plants (40%). The combination of nutraceutical and exercise decreased the animals' body weights and inflammatory markers (TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and resistin) in plasma, while increasing gene expression of <i>cat</i>, <i>sod2</i>, <i>gsta2</i>, and <i>nqo1</i> in the liver. Obese animals showed lower \u03b2-diversity of microbiota and a higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio vs. normocaloric controls that were reversed by all interventions implemented. Dietary inclusion of a nutraceutical with high antioxidant potential combined with an exercise protocol can be beneficial for bodyweight control and improvement of metabolic status in patients undergoing obesity treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Increased levels of lactate, an end-product of glycolysis, have been proposed as a potential surrogate marker for metabolic changes during neuronal excitation. These changes in lactate levels can result in decreased brain pH, which has been implicated in patients with various neuropsychiatric disorders. We previously demonstrated that such alterations are commonly observed in five mouse models of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism, suggesting a shared endophenotype among these disorders rather than mere artifacts due to medications or agonal state. However, there is still limited research on this phenomenon in animal models, leaving its generality across other disease animal models uncertain. Moreover, the association between changes in brain lactate levels and specific behavioral abnormalities remains unclear. To address these gaps, the International Brain pH Project Consortium investigated brain pH and lactate levels in 109 strains/conditions of 2294 animals with genetic and other experimental manipulations relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders. Systematic analysis revealed that decreased brain pH and increased lactate levels were common features observed in multiple models of depression, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and some additional schizophrenia models. While certain autism models also exhibited decreased pH and increased lactate levels, others showed the opposite pattern, potentially reflecting subpopulations within the autism spectrum. Furthermore, utilizing large-scale behavioral test battery, a multivariate cross-validated prediction analysis demonstrated that poor working memory performance was predominantly associated with increased brain lactate levels. Importantly, this association was confirmed in an independent cohort of animal models. Collectively, these findings suggest that altered brain pH and lactate levels, which could be attributed to dysregulated excitation/inhibition balance, may serve as transdiagnostic endophenotypes of debilitating neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by cognitive impairment, irrespective of their beneficial or detrimental nature.",

        "Abstract": "Multisensory integration is necessary for the animal to survive in the real world. While conventional methods have been extensively used to investigate the multisensory integration process in various brain areas, its long-range interactions remain less explored. In this study, our goal was to investigate interactions between visual and somatosensory networks on a whole-brain scale using 15.2-T BOLD fMRI. We compared unimodal to bimodal BOLD fMRI responses and dissected potential cross-modal pathways with silencing of primary visual cortex (V1) by optogenetic stimulation of local GABAergic neurons. Our data showed that the influence of visual stimulus on whisker activity is higher than the influence of whisker stimulus on visual activity. Optogenetic silencing of V1 revealed that visual information is conveyed to whisker processing via both V1 and non-V1 pathways. The first-order ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus (VPM) was functionally affected by non-V1 sources, while the higher-order posterior medial thalamic nucleus (POm) was predominantly modulated by V1 but not non-V1 inputs. The primary somatosensory barrel field (S1BF) was influenced by both V1 and non-V1 inputs. These observations provide valuable insights for into the integration of whisker and visual sensory information.",

        "Abstract": "Microglial neuroinflammation appears to be neuroprotective in the early pathological stage, yet neurotoxic, which often precedes neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unclear how the microglial activities transit to the neurotoxic state during AD progression, due to complex neuron-glia interactions. Here, the mechanism of detrimental microgliosis in AD by employing 3D human AD mini-brains, brain tissues of AD patients, and 5XFAD mice is explored. In the human and animal AD models, amyloid-beta (A\u03b2)-overexpressing neurons and reactive astrocytes produce interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) and excessive oxidative stress. IFN\u03b3 results in the downregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the upregulation of Kelch-like ECH-associated Protein 1 (Keap1) in microglia, which inactivate nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and sensitize microglia to the oxidative stress and induces a proinflammatory microglia via nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB)-axis. The proinflammatory microglia in turn produce neurotoxic nitric oxide and proinflammatory mediators exacerbating synaptic impairment, phosphorylated-tau accumulation, and discernable neuronal loss. Interestingly, recovering Nrf2 in the microglia prevents the activation of proinflammatory microglia and significantly blocks the tauopathy in AD minibrains. Taken together, it is envisioned that IFN\u03b3-driven Nrf2 downregulation in microglia as a key target to ameliorate AD pathology.",

        "Abstract": "Stress-induced intestinal epithelial injury (IEI) and a delay in repair in infancy are predisposing factors for refractory gut diseases in adulthood, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Hence, it is necessary to develop appropriate mitigation methods for mammals when experiencing early-life stress (ELS). Weaning, as we all know, is a vital procedure that all mammalian newborns, including humans, must go through. Maternal separation (MS) stress in infancy (regarded as weaning stress in animal science) is a commonly used ELS paradigm. Drinking silicon-rich alkaline mineral water (AMW) has a therapeutic effect on enteric disease, but the specific mechanisms involved have not been reported. Herein, we discover the molecular mechanism by which silicon-rich AMW repairs ELS-induced IEI by maintaining intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation and differentiation through the glucagon-like peptide (GLP)2-Wnt1 axis. Mechanistic study showed that silicon-rich AMW activates GLP2-dependent Wnt1/\u03b2-catenin pathway, and drives ISC proliferation and differentiation by stimulating Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISC cell cycle passage through the G1-S-phase checkpoint, thereby maintaining intestinal epithelial regeneration and IEI repair. Using GLP2 antagonists (GLP2<sup>3-33</sup>) and small interfering RNA (SiWnt1) in vitro, we found that the GLP2-Wnt1 axis is the target of silicon-rich AMW to promote intestinal epithelium regeneration. Therefore, silicon-rich AMW maintains intestinal epithelium regeneration through the GLP2-Wnt1 axis in piglets under ELS. Our research contributes to understanding the mechanism of silicon-rich AMW promoting gut epithelial regeneration and provides a new strategy for the alleviation of ELS-induced IEI.",

Lung organoid, a miniaturized structure recapitulating lung tissue, has gained global attention because of its advantages over other conventional models such as two-dimensional (2D) cell models and animal models. Nevertheless, lung organoids still face limitations concerning heterogeneity, complexity, and maturity compared to the native lung tissue. To address these limitations, researchers have employed co-culture methods with various cell types including endothelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and immune cells, and incorporated bioengineering platforms such as air-liquid interfaces, microfluidic chips, and functional hydrogels. These advancements have facilitated applications of lung organoids to studies of pulmonary diseases, providing insights into disease mechanisms and potential treatments. This review introduces recent progress in the production methods of lung organoids, strategies for improving maturity, functionality, and complexity of organoids, and their application in disease modeling, including respiratory infection and pulmonary fibrosis.",

        "Abstract": "The brain-gut axis plays a vital role in connecting the cognitive and emotional centers of the brain with the intricate workings of the intestines. An imbalance in the microbiota-mediated brain-gut axis extends far beyond conditions like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and obesity, playing a critical role in the development and progression of various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, depression, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Epilepsy, a brain disorder characterized by unprovoked seizures, affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that rebuilding the gut microbiota through interventions such as fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, and ketogenic diets (KD) can benefit drug-resistant epilepsy. The disturbances in the gut microbiota could contribute to the toxic side effects of antiepileptic drugs and the development of drug resistance in epilepsy patients. These findings imply the potential impact of the gut microbiota on epilepsy and suggest that interventions targeting the microbiota, such as the KD, hold promise for managing and treating epilepsy. However, the full extent of the importance of microbiota in epilepsy treatment is not yet fully understood, and many aspects of this field remain unclear. Therefore, this article aims to provide an overview of the clinical and animal evidence supporting the regulatory role of gut microbiota in epilepsy, and of potential pathways within the brain-gut axis that may be influenced by the gut microbiota in epilepsy. Furthermore, we will discuss the recent advancements in epilepsy treatment, including the KD, fecal microbiota transplantation, and antiseizure drugs, all from the perspective of the gut microbiota.",

        "Abstract": "A cell's ability to secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) for communication is present in all three domains of life. Notably, Gram-negative bacteria produce a specific type of EVs called outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). We previously observed the presence of OMVs in human blood, which could represent a means of communication from the microbiota to the host. Here, in order to investigate the possible translocation of OMVs from the intestine to other organs, the mouse was used as an animal model after OMVs administration. To achieve this, we first optimized the signal of OMVs containing the fluorescent protein miRFP713 associated with the outer membrane anchoring peptide OmpA by adding biliverdin, a fluorescence cofactor, to the cultures. The miRFP713-expressing OMVs produced in <i>E. coli</i> REL606 strain were then characterized according to their diameter and protein composition. Native- and miRFP713-expressing OMVs were found to produce homogenous populations of vesicles. Finally, in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence imaging was used to monitor the distribution of miRFP713-OMVs in mice in various organs whether by intravenous injection or oral gavage. The relative stability of the fluorescence signals up to 3 days post-injection/gavage paves the way to future studies investigating the OMV-based communication established between the different microbiotas and their host.",

There are few reports on the use of Kampo medicines for the treatment of IBS-D. Shakuyakukanzoto (SKT) is a Kampo medicine that is effective against abdominal pain. We examined the relationship between SKT and intestinal peristalsis in an animal model and a prospective study. In the animal model, SKT and its components were administered from the serosal side of the colon and colonic peristalsis was evaluated using intraluminal pressure and spatiotemporal mapping before and after the administration of SKT and its components. In this clinical trial, we used abdominal ultrasonography (US) to obtain long-axis images of the sigmoid colon of 11 patients. The frequency of intestinal peristalsis was measured using US in five patients with SKT and six patients without medication after the ingestion of a test meal. The primary outcome was the frequency of peristalsis. The Clinical Trial Registry Website (Trial No. UMIN-CTR; UMIN000051547).

Here, we present continuous measurements of local IOP values in the anterior chamber and vitreous chamber of living animals using minimally invasive probes with pressure-sensitive transistors. After inducing glaucoma in animal models, we compared the local IOP distribution between normal and glaucomatous eyes. We also compared IOP values detected in the cornea using tonometry measurements.

Metastatic tumors undergo a multitude of transformations, including genetic diversification, adaptation to diverse microenvironments, and modified drug responses, contributing significantly to cancer-related mortality. Micro-physiological systems (MPS) technology emerges as a promising approach to emulate the metastatic process by integrating critical biochemical, biomechanical, and geometrical cues at a microscale. These systems are particularly advantageous simulating metastasis organotropism, the phenomenon where tumors exhibit a preference for metastasizing to particular organs. Organotropism is influenced by various factors, such as tumor cell characteristics, unique organ microenvironments, and organ-specific vascular conditions, all of which can be effectively examined using MPS. This review surveys the recent developments in MPS research from the past five years, with a specific focus on their applications in replicating tumor metastasis and organotropism.

        "Abstract": "Tularemia is a zoonosis caused by the Gram negative, facultative intracellular bacterium <i>Francisella tularensis</i>. This disease has multiple clinical presentations according to the route of infection, the virulence of the infecting bacterial strain, and the underlying medical condition of infected persons. Systemic infections (e.g., pneumonic and typhoidal form) and complications are rare but may be life threatening. Most people suffer from local infection (e.g., skin ulcer, conjunctivitis, or pharyngitis) with regional lymphadenopathy, which evolve to suppuration in about 30% of patients and a chronic course of infection. Current treatment recommendations have been established to manage acute infections in the context of a biological threat and do not consider the great variability of clinical situations. This review summarizes literature data on antibiotic efficacy against <i>F. tularensis in vitro</i>, in animal models, and in humans. Empirical treatment with beta-lactams, most macrolides, or anti-tuberculosis agents is usually ineffective. The aminoglycosides gentamicin and streptomycin remain the gold standard for severe infections, and the fluoroquinolones and doxycycline for infections of mild severity, although current data indicate the former are usually more effective. However, the antibiotic treatments reported in the literature are highly variable in their composition and duration depending on the clinical manifestations, the age and health status of the patient, the presence of complications, and the evolution of the disease. Many patients received several antibiotics in combination or successively. Whatever the antibiotic treatment administered, variable but high rates of treatment failures and relapses are still observed, especially in patients treated more then 2-3 weeks after disease onset. In these patients, surgical treatment is often necessary for cure, including drainage or removal of suppurative lymph nodes or other infectious foci. It is currently difficult to establish therapeutic recommendations, particularly due to lack of comparative randomized studies. However, we have attempted to summarize current knowledge through proposals for improving tularemia treatment which will have to be discussed by a group of experts. A major factor in improving the prognosis of patients with tularemia is the early administration of appropriate treatment, which requires better medical knowledge and diagnostic strategy of this disease.",

        "Abstract": "Iron deficiency is the top leading cause of anaemia, whose treatment has been shown to deteriorate gut health. However, a comprehensive analysis of the intestinal barrier and the gut microbiome during IDA have not been performed to date. This study aims to delve further into the analysis of these two aspects, which will mean a step forward minimising the negative impact of iron supplements on intestinal health. IDA was experimentally induced in an animal model. Shotgun sequencing was used to analyse the gut microbiome in the colonic region, while the intestinal barrier was studied through histological analyses, mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), qPCR and immunofluorescence. Determinations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bacteria-specific immunoglobulins were performed to assess microbial translocation. Microbial metabolism in the colon shifted towards an increased production of certain amino acids, short chain fatty acids and nucleotides, with Clostridium species being enriched during IDA. Structural alterations of the colonic epithelium were shown by histological analysis. RNA-Seq revealed a downregulation of extracellular matrix-associated genes and proteins and an overall underdeveloped epithelium. Increased levels of serum LPS and an increased immune response against dysbiotic bacteria support an impairment in the integrity of the gut barrier during IDA. IDA negatively impacts the gut microbiome and the intestinal barrier, triggering an increased microbial translocation. This study emphasizes the deterioration of gut health during IDA and the fact that it should be addressed when treating the disease.",

Plant- and animal-derived foods had significantly different impacts on the abundances of bacterial taxa. Animal and vegetable fats, fish and dairy products led to increases in many taxa, mainly within the Lachnospiraceae. In particular, fats favored increases in the beneficial bacteria <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Blautia</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i>. However, butter, as well as gouda cheese and fish, also resulted in the increase of <i>Lachnoclostridium</i>, associated to several diseases. Frying and boiling produced the most distinct effects on the microbiota, with members of the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae responding the most to the cooking method employed. Nevertheless, cooking effects were highly individualized and food-dependent, challenging the investigation of their role in personalized diets.",

        "Title": "Systematic Review on Herbal Preparations for Controlling Visceral Hypersensitivity in Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders.",
        "Abstract": "Visceral hypersensitivity (VH) is an overreaction of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to various stimuli and is characterized by hyperalgesia and/or allodynia. VH contributes to the etiology of many GI dysfunctions, particularly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the exact mechanisms underlying VH are yet to be found, inflammation and oxidative stress, psychosocial factors, and sensorimotor alterations may play significant roles in it. In this review, we provide an overview of VH and its pathophysiological function in GI disorders. Adverse effects of synthetic drugs may make herbal agents a good candidate for pain management. Therefore, in this review, we will discuss the efficacy of herbal agents in the management of VH with a focus on their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potentials. Data were extracted from clinical and animal studies published in English between 2004 and June, 2020, which were collected from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. Overall, Radix, Melissia, Glycyrrhizae, Mentha, and Liquorice were the most efficient herbals for VH management in IBS and dyspepsia, predominantly through modulation of the mRNA expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) and suppression of 5- hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) or the serotonin receptors. Considering the positive effects of herbal formulations in VH management, further research on novel herbal and/or herbal/chemical preparations is warranted.",

        "Abstract": "Gut - brain communications disorders in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are associated with intestinal microbiota composition, increased gut permeability, and psychosocial disturbances. Symptoms of IBS are difficult to medicate, and hence much research is being made into alternative approaches. This study assesses the potential of a treatment with pasteurized Akkermansia muciniphila for alleviating IBS-like symptoms in two mouse models of IBS with different etiologies. Two clinically relevant animal models were used to mimic IBS-like symptoms in C57BL6/J mice: the neonatal maternal separation (NMS) paradigm and the Citrobacter rodentium infection model. In both models, gut permeability, colonic sensitivity, fecal microbiota composition and colonic IL-22 expression were evaluated. The cognitive performance and emotional state of the animals were also assessed by several tests in the C. rodentium infection model. The neuromodulation ability of pasteurized A. muciniphila was assessed on primary neuronal cells from mice dorsal root ganglia using a ratiometric calcium imaging approach. The administration of pasteurized A. muciniphila significantly reduced colonic hypersensitivity in both IBS mouse models, accompanied by a reinforcement of the intestinal barrier function. Beneficial effects of pasteurized A. muciniphila treatment have also been observed on anxiety-like behavior and memory defects in the C. rodentium infection model. Finally, a neuroinhibitory effect exerted by pasteurized A. muciniphila was observed on neuronal cells stimulated with two algogenic substances such as capsaicin and inflammatory soup. Our findings demonstrate novel anti-hyperalgesic and neuroinhibitory properties of pasteurized A. muciniphila, which therefore may have beneficial effects in relieving pain and anxiety in subjects with IBS.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To systematically evaluate the efficacy of moxibustion in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) model rats. <b>Methods:</b> A comprehensive search was conducted in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Data, VIP, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from their inception to June 30, 2023. Relevant animal experiments investigating moxibustion for treating IBS-D in model rats were included. Two independent researchers screened the literature, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias in the selected studies. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. <b>Results:</b> In total, 21 animal studies comprising 680 model rats were included. The meta-analysis results demonstrated that moxibustion enhanced the threshold capacity of the abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09, 2.60; <i>p</i> < 0.00001], ameliorated the rate of loose stool (SMD = -4.03; 95% CI: -5.76, -2.30; <i>p</i> < 0.00001), and decreased the colon 5-hydroxytryptamine (SMD = -3.67; 95% CI: -5.33, -2.01; <i>p</i> < 0.00001), serum interleukin-1\u03b2 (SMD = -3.24, 95% CI: -4.06, -2.41; <i>p</i> < 0.00001), serum tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (SMD = -2.35, 95% CI: -4.12, -0.58; <i>p</i> < 0.00001), and serum substance P (SMD = -5.14, 95% CI: -8.45, -1.83; <i>p</i> = 0.002) concentrations. Moxibustion did not affect the blood calcitonin gene-related peptide level compared to the blank model group (<i>p</i> = 0.15). <b>Conclusion:</b> Moxibustion modulated the brain-gut interaction, reduced visceral hypersensitivity, inhibited intestinal inflammation, and regulated the immune balance, improving the rate of loose stool and increasing the AWR threshold capacity in IBS-D model rats, achieving good analgesic and antidiarrheal effects. However, these conclusions require further validation due to limitations in the quantity and quality of the included studies.",

        "Abstract": "It is currently unknown whether ultra-processed foods (UPFs) consumption is associated with a higher incidence of multimorbidity. We examined the relationship of total and subgroup consumption of UPFs with the risk of multimorbidity defined as the co-occurrence of at least two chronic diseases in an individual among first cancer at any site, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. This was a prospective cohort study including 266,666 participants (60% women) free of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes at recruitment from seven European countries in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Foods and drinks consumed over the previous 12 months were assessed at baseline by food-frequency questionnaires and classified according to their degree of processing using Nova classification. We used multistate modelling based on Cox regression to estimate cause-specific hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of total and subgroups of UPFs with the risk of multimorbidity of cancer and cardiometabolic diseases. After a median of 11.2 years of follow-up, 4461 participants (39% women) developed multimorbidity of cancer and cardiometabolic diseases. Higher UPF consumption (per 1 standard deviation increment, \u223c260\u00a0g/day without alcoholic drinks) was associated with an increased risk of multimorbidity of cancer and cardiometabolic diseases (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.12). Among UPF subgroups, associations were most notable for animal-based products (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.12), and artificially and sugar-sweetened beverages (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.12). Other subgroups such as ultra-processed breads and cereals (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.00) or plant-based alternatives (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.02) were not associated with risk. Our findings suggest that higher consumption of UPFs increases the risk of cancer and cardiometabolic multimorbidity.

        "Abstract": "We examine some of the genetic features of neuroticism (N) taking as an animal model the Maudsley Reactive (MR) and Maudsley Nonreactive (MNR) rat strains which were selectively bred, respectively, for high and low open-field defecation (OFD) starting in the late 1950s. To draw analogies with human genetic studies, we explore the genetic correlation of N with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We review progress with the rat model and developments in the field of human complex trait genetics, including genetic association studies that relate to current understanding of the genetics of N. The widespread differences in the tone of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system that have been found between the Maudsley strains, particularly those observed in the colon, may underly the differences in OFD (MNR, higher sympathetic tone and zero defecation). In humans, a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) reported six genes contributing to IBS, four of which were implicated in mood and anxiety disorders or were expressed in the brain, with three of the four also expressed in the nerve fibers and ganglia of the gut. Heritability of N is estimated at around 50% in twin and family studies, and GWASs identified hundreds of loci, enabling estimation of genome-wide correlations (r<sub>g</sub>) with other traits. Significantly, the estimate for r<sub>g</sub> between risk of IBS, anxiety, N, and depression was >0.5 and suggested genetic pleiotropy without evidence for causal mechanisms. Findings on the adrenergic pharmacology of the colon, coupled with new understanding of the role of the locus ceruleus in modifying afferent information from this organ, generate hypotheses that challenge traditional cause/effect notions about the relationship of the central nervous system to peripheral events in response to stress, suggest specific targets for gene action in the Maudsley model and emphasize the value of reciprocal evaluation of genetic architecture underlying N in rodents and humans.",

        "Abstract": "Animal and human studies have suggested that trihalomethane (THM) has toxicity to bone. In this study, we included adolescents from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who had quantified blood and tap water THM concentrations [chloroform (TCM), bromodichloromethane (BDCM), dibromochloromethane (DBCM), and bromoform (TBM)] and lumbar spine or total body less head (TBLH) bone mineral density (BMD). A 2.7-fold increase in concentrations of blood TCM, DBCM, chlorinated THMs (the sum of TCM, BDCM, and DBCM), and total THMs (the sum of 4 THMs) was associated with lower lumbar spine BMD z-scores by -0.06 [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.12, -0.01], -0.06 (95% CI: -0.11, -0.003), -0.08 (95% CI: -0.14, -0.02), and -0.07 (95% CI: -0.13, -0.003), respectively, in adjusted models.

Low-to-moderate predictive power was attained when tap water THM concentrations were used to predict blood THM measurements. Notably, the inverse associations for blood THMs persisted exclusively between water concentrations of DBCM and Br-THMs and the TBLH BMD <i>z</i>-scores.

        "Abstract": "Sex differences in declarative memory are described in humans, revealing a female or a male advantage depending on the task. Specifically, spatial memory (i.e., spatial navigation) is typically most efficient in men. This sexual dimorphism has been replicated in male rats but not clearly in mice. In this study, sex differences in spatial memory were assessed in thirty-six C57BL/6\u00a0J mice (Janvier Labs; i.e., C57BL/6JRj mice), a widely used mouse substrain. Both male and female mice (12 weeks-old) were subjected to standard behavioral paradigms: the elevated plus maze, the open field test, the novel object and place tests, the forced swimming test, and the water maze test for spatial navigation. Across assessment, no sex differences were found in measures of locomotor activity, emotional and behavioral responses, and object and place recognition memories. In the water maze, male mice were faster in learning the platform location in the reference memory training and used more spatial strategies during the first training days. However, both sexes reached a similar asymptotic performance and performed similarly in the probe trial for long-term memory consolidation. No sex differences were found in the cued training, platform inversion sessions, or spatial working memory sessions. Hippocampal expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor was similar in both sexes, either in basal conditions or after performing the behavioral training battery. Importantly, female mice were not more variable than males in any measure analyzed. This outcome encourages the investigation of sex differences in animal models and the usefulness of including female mice in behavioral research.",

In this study, we investigate the effects of increased methanogens or H<sub>2</sub>S producers on stool phenotypes in rat models. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were fed high-fat diet (HFD) for 60\u00a0days to increase M. smithii levels, then gavaged for 10\u00a0days with water (controls) or methanogenesis inhibitors. To increase H<sub>2</sub>S producers, rats were gavaged with F. varium or D. piger. Stool consistency (stool wet weight (SWW)) and gas production were measured. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on stool samples. In HFD diet-fed rats (N\u2009=\u200930), stool M. smithii levels were\u00a0increased (P\u2009<\u20090.001) after 52\u00a0days, correlating with significantly decreased SWW (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) at 59\u00a0days (R\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.38, P\u2009=\u20090.037). Small bowel M.\u00a0smithii levels decreased significantly in lovastatin lactone-treated rats (P\u2009<\u20090.0006), and SWW increased (normalized) in lovastatin hydroxyacid-treated rats (P\u2009=\u20090.0246), vs. controls (N\u2009=\u200910/group). SWW increased significantly in D.\u00a0piger-gavaged rats (N\u2009=\u200916) on day 10 (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), and in F.\u00a0varium-gavaged rats (N\u2009=\u200916) at all timepoints, vs. controls, with increased stool H<sub>2</sub>S production. 16S sequencing revealed stool microbiota alterations in rats gavaged with H<sub>2</sub>S producers, with higher relative abundance (RA) of other H<sub>2</sub>S producers, particularly Lachnospiraceae and Bilophila in F.\u00a0varium-gavaged rats, and Sutterella in D.\u00a0piger-gavaged rats. These findings suggest that increased M. smithii levels result in a constipation-like phenotype in a rat model that is partly reversible with methanogenesis inhibitors, whereas gavage with H<sub>2</sub>S producers D.\u00a0piger or F.\u00a0varium results in increased colonization with other H<sub>2</sub>S producers and diarrhea-like phenotypes. This supports roles for the increased RA of methanogens and H<sub>2</sub>S producers identified in IBS-C and IBS-D subjects, respectively, in contributing to stool phenotypes.",

        "Abstract": "Sensorineural hearing loss is very difficult to treat. Currently, one of the techniques used for hearing rehabilitation is a cochlear implant that can transform sound into electrical signals instead of inner ear hair cells. However, the prognosis remains very poor if sufficient auditory nerve cells are not secured. In this study, the effect of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) and photobiomodulation (PBM) combined treatment on auditory function and auditory nerve cells in a secondary neuropathy animal model was investigated. To confirm the engraftment of stem cells in vitro, cochlear explants were treated with kanamycin (KM) to mimic nerve damage and then cocultured with GFP-mESC. GFP-mESCs were observed to have attached and integrated into the explanted samples. An animal model for secondary neurodegeneration was achieved by KM treatment and was treated by a combination therapy of GFP-mESC and NIR-PBM at 8 weeks of KM treatment. Hearing recovery by functional testing using auditory brain stem response (ABR) and eABR was measured as well as morphological changes and epifluorescence analysis were conducted after 2 weeks of combination therapy. KM treatment elevated the hearing threshold at 70-80\u2009dB and even after the combination treatment with GFP-mESC and PBM was applied, the auditory function was not restored. In addition, the stem cells transplanted into cochlea has exponentially increased due to PBM treatment although did not produce any malignancy. This study confirmed that the combined treatment with mESC and PBM could not improve hearing or increase the response of the auditory nerve. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy in this study that the cells are distributed in most cochlear tissues and the proliferation of stem cells was very active in animals irradiated with PBM compared to other groups wherein the stem cells had disappeared immediately after transplantation or existed for only a short period of time.",

These compounds can cross the placental barrier and interfere with the hormonal system of newborns. To determine concentrations of OCPs and PCBs and their xenoestrogenic activity in placentas of women from the PA-MAMI cohort of Panama. Thirty-nine placenta samples from women in the Azuero peninsula (Panama) were analyzed. Five OCPs [p-p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p-p'-DDE), beta-hexachlorohexane (\u03b2-HCH), \u03b3-hexachlorohexane (lindane), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and mirex] and three PCB congeners (PCB-138, PCB-153 and PCB-180) were quantified in placenta extracts. The xenoestrogenic activity of extracts was assessed with the E-Screen bioassay to estimate the total effective xenoestrogen burden (TEXB). All placental samples were positive for at least three POP residues and >70% for at least six. The frequencies of quantified OCPs ranged from 100% for p,p'-DDE and HCB to 30.8% for \u03b2-HCH. The highest median concentration was for lindane (380.0\u00a0pg/g placenta), followed by p,p'-DDE (280.0\u00a0pg/g placenta), and HCB (90.0\u00a0pg/g placenta). Exposure to p,p'-DDE was associated with greater meat consumption, suggesting that animal fat is a major source of exposure to DDT metabolites. The frequency of detected PCBs ranged between 70 and 90%; the highest median concentration was for PCB 138 (17.0\u00a0pg/g placenta), followed by PCB 153 (16.0\u00a0pg/g placenta). All placentas were positive in the estrogenicity bioassay with a median TEXB-\u03b1 of 0.91 pM Eeq/g of placenta. Exposure to lindane was positively associated with the xenoestrogenicity of TEXB- \u03b1, whereas this association was negative in the case of exposure to PCB 153. To our best knowledge, this study contributes the first evidence on the presence of POPs and xenoestrogenic burden in placentas from Latin-American women. Given concerns about the consequences of prenatal exposure to these compounds on children's health, preventive measures are highly recommended to eliminate or minimize the risk of OCP exposure during pregnancy.",

We previously demonstrated intestinal barrier disruption and signs of inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Fecal calprotectin is a disease activity biomarker in inflammatory bowel diseases, released by neutrophils in response to inflammation. We aimed to further investigate EAE manifestations in the gastrointestinal tract and to determine whether calprotectin is a useful biomarker of intestinal inflammation in EAE. Calprotectin was analyzed in feces, cecal contents, and plasma of EAE mice. Infiltrating neutrophils and goblet cells were investigated in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract before the onset of neurological symptoms and during established disease. We found increased calprotectin levels in feces, cecal content, and plasma preceding EAE onset that further escalated during disease progression. Increased neutrophil infiltration in the intestinal tissue concomitant with IL-17 expression and myeloperoxidase activity was found to correlate well with clinical activity. Increased goblet cells in the intestine, similar to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), were also observed.

        "Abstract": "As diabetes rates surge globally, there is a corresponding rise in the number of patients suffering from diabetic kidney disease (DKD), a common complication of diabetes. DKD is a significant contributor to chronic kidney disease, often leading to end-stage renal failure. However, the effectiveness of current medical treatments for DKD leaves much to be desired. Molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) is an antioxidant that selectively reduces hydroxyl radicals, a reactive oxygen species with a very potent oxidative capacity. Recent studies have demonstrated that H<sub>2</sub> not only possesses antioxidant properties but also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, regulates cell lethality, and modulates signal transduction. Consequently, it is now being utilized in clinical applications. Many factors contribute to the onset and progression of DKD, with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation being strongly implicated. Recent preclinical and clinical trials reported that substances with antioxidant properties may slow the progression of DKD. Hence, we undertook a comprehensive review of the literature focusing on animal models and human clinical trials where H<sub>2</sub> demonstrated effectiveness against a variety of renal diseases. The collective evidence from this literature review, along with our previous findings, suggests that H<sub>2</sub> may have therapeutic benefits for patients with DKD by enhancing mitochondrial function. To substantiate these findings, future large-scale clinical studies are needed.",

        "Title": "Differences in bone microarchitecture between genetic and secondary iron-overload mouse models suggest a role for hepcidin deficiency in iron-related osteoporosis.",
        "Abstract": "Iron overload is one of the secondary osteoporosis etiologies. Cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in iron-related osteoporosis are not fully understood. The aim of the study was to investigate the respective roles of iron excess and hepcidin, the systemic iron regulator, in the development of iron-related osteoporosis. We used mice models with genetic iron overload (GIO) related to hepcidin deficiency (Hfe<sup>-/-</sup> and Bmp6<sup>-/-</sup> ) and secondary iron overload (SIO) exhibiting a hepcidin increase secondary to iron excess. Iron concentration and transferrin saturation levels were evaluated in serum and hepatic, spleen, and bone iron concentrations were assessed by ICP-MS and Perl's staining. Gene expression was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. Bone micro-architecture was evaluated by micro-CT. The osteoblastic MC3T3 murine cells that are able to mineralize were exposed to iron and/or hepcidin. Despite an increase of bone iron concentration in all overloaded mice models, bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) only decreased significantly in GIO, at 12\u2009months for Hfe<sup>-/-</sup> and from 6\u2009months for Bmp6<sup>-/-</sup> . Alterations in bone microarchitecture in the Bmp6<sup>-/-</sup> model were positively correlated with hepcidin levels (BV/TV (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009+.481, p\u2009<\u2009.05) and Tb.Th (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009+.690, p\u2009<\u2009.05). Iron deposits were detected in the bone trabeculae of Hfe<sup>-/-</sup> and Bmp6<sup>-/-</sup> mice, while iron deposits were mainly visible in bone marrow macrophages in secondary iron overload. In cell cultures, ferric ammonium citrate exposure abolished the mineralization process for concentrations above 5\u2009\u03bcM, with a parallel decrease in osteocalcin, collagen 1, and alkaline phosphatase mRNA levels. Hepcidin supplementation of cells had a rescue effect on the collagen 1 and alkaline phosphatase expression level decrease. Together, these data suggest that iron in excess alone is not sufficient to induce osteoporosis and that low hepcidin levels also contribute to the development of osteoporosis.",

        "Abstract": "This review discusses the recent developments on the understanding of epidemiology and genetics of Meniere's disease. Meniere's disease has been shown to be associated with several comorbidities, such as migraine, anxiety, allergy and immune disorders. Recent studies have investigated the relationship between environmental factors and Meniere's disease such as air pollution, allergy, asthma, osteoporosis or atmospheric pressure, reporting specific comorbidities in East Asian population. The application of exome sequencing has enabled the identification of genes sharing rare missense variants in multiple families with Meniere's disease, including OTOG and TECTA and suggesting digenic inheritance in MYO7A . Moreover, knockdown of DTNA gene orthologue in Drosophila resulted in defective proprioception and auditory function. DTNA and FAM136A knockout mice have been studied as potential mouse models for Meniere's disease. While it has attracted emerging attention in recent years, the study of Meniere's disease genetics is still at its early stage. More geographically and ethnically based human genome studies, and the development of cellular and animal models of Meniere's disease may help shed light on the molecular mechanisms of Meniere's disease and provide the potential for gene-specific therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic intestinal disorder characterized by abdominal discomfort, stool characteristics, and changes in bowel habits. Among them, diarrhea-type (diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, abbreviated as IBS-D) is the most common. Because its pathogenesis is not understood, symptomatic treatment is currently used in clinical practice, and its long-term effect is still unclear. Decoction of Angelica sinensis, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, and Mutton (DAZM) is a famous traditional Chinese medicine recipe created by Zhang Zhongjing, a famous doctor in the Eastern Han Dynasty 2000 years ago, and is still in use today. Our research team has previously investigated the clinical study of DAZM in the treatment of IBS-D and conducted animal experiment research, indicating that DAZM has a significant effect on improving IBS-D. Yet, there are few reports on the specific mechanism of action of DAZM in improving the treatment of IBS and related types. Most studies discuss and verify its efficacy and protection from a clinical perspective. For this reason, this research will explore the constituent targets and mechanisms of DAZM to improve the treatment of IBS-D, provide relevant scientific evidence, and also provide reference evidence for the efficacy of food therapy decoction in improving the treatment of diseases and mechanism to open up new experimental research ideas. Identification of drug ingredients and collection of targets for DAZM using ultra-performance liquid chromatography with linear ion trap-electrostatic field orbitrap mass spectrometry and the Bioinformatics Analysis Tool for Molecular Mechanisms of Traditional Chinese Medicine database, active ingredients were selected based on their oral bioavailability and drug-like properties. Obtained IBS-D targets using the GeneCards database, took the intersection of IBS-D targets and DAZM targets and obtained potential targets of DAZM for the treatment of IBS-D. Using Cytoscape software to draw a network diagram of \"Food therapy decoction-ingredient-target-disease\" and selected the ingredients with larger parameter values by topological analysis. Correlation analysis of the selected active and parametric ingredients with prominent symptoms of IBS-D using SymMap database, and selection of potential core ingredients. The construction of protein interaction networks from the String database and the selection of potential core targets. Gene Ontology functional and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathway enrichment analyses using the Metascape database, establishing the bioinformatic processes and signaling pathways involved. Molecular docking of core ingredients and potential core targets was performed using AutoDock Vina, and the results were visualized using Python molecule (PyMOL) and LigPlus+. Finally, based on the results of this research combined with previous literature reports, the discussion section of this paper summarizes in detail the key core ingredients, targets, and signaling pathways of DAZM in improving IBS-D. DAZM may act on eight potential core targets (threonine kinase 1, insulin, tumour necrosis factor, tumour protein p53, interleukin 6, epidermal growth factor receptor, connexin \u03b21, and interleukin 1\u03b2) through eight core ingredients (Zingiberone, Shyobunone, Palmitic acid, Sebiferic acid, \u03b2-Bisabolene, \u03b2-Sitosterol, Stigmasterol, and Oleic acid). inhibit pro-inflammatory factors through Advanced Glycation End Products-Receptor (AGE-RAGE) signaling pathway, Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, Calmodulin (CaM) signaling pathway, and other pathways. It can alleviate the inflammatory response, enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier and regulate intestinal motility, and play a role in the treatment and improvement of IBS-D. This research mainly found the mechanism of DAZM on IBS-D, which may involve multiple ingredients, multiple targets, and multiple pathways. DAZM with medicinal and edible functions can effectively improve the treatment of IBS-D. This kind of dietary therapy is suitable for long-term treatment and is worthy of promotion.",

        "Abstract": "Dopamine synapses play a crucial role in volitional movement and reward-related behaviors, while dysfunction of dopamine synapses causes various psychiatric and neurological disorders. Despite this significance, the true biological nature of dopamine synapses remains poorly understood. Here, we show that dopamine transmission is strongly correlated with GABA co-transmission across the brain and dopamine synapses are\u00a0structured and function like GABAergic synapses with marked regional heterogeneity. In addition, GABAergic-like dopamine synapses are clustered on the dendrites, and GABA transmission at dopamine synapses has distinct physiological properties. Interestingly, the knockdown of neuroligin-2, a key postsynaptic protein at GABAergic synapses, unexpectedly does not weaken GABA co-transmission but instead facilitates it at dopamine synapses in the striatal neurons. More importantly, the attenuation of GABA co-transmission precedes deficits in dopaminergic transmission in animal models of Parkinson's disease. Our findings reveal the spatial and functional nature of GABAergic-like dopamine synapses in health and disease.",

Since its discovery, infections have spread throughout East Asian countries primarily through tick bites but also via transmission between animals and humans. The expanding range of ticks, the primary vectors for SFTSV, combined with migration patterns of tick-carrying birds, sets the stage for the global spread of this virus. SFTSV rapidly evolves due to continuous mutation and reassortment; currently, no approved vaccines or antiviral drugs are available. Thus, the threat this virus poses to global health is unmistakable.

        "Abstract": "Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are 2 chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) that present with significant comorbidity. Both conditions are more prevalent in women and are exacerbated by stress. While peripheral mechanisms might contribute to pain hypersensitivity for each individual condition, mechanisms underlying the comorbidity are poorly understood, complicating pain management when multiple conditions are involved. In this study, longitudinal behavioral and functional MRI-based brain changes have been identified in an animal model of TMD-like pain (masseter muscle inflammation followed by stress) that induces de novo IBS-like comorbid visceral pain hypersensitivity in rats. In particular, data indicate that increased activity in the insula and regions of the reward and limbic systems are associated with more pronounced and longer-lasting visceral pain behaviors in female rats, while the faster pain resolution in male rats may be due to increased activity in descending pain inhibitory pathways. These findings suggest the critical role of brain mechanisms in chronic pain conditions and that sex may be a risk factor of developing COPCs.",

        "Abstract": "Gait analysis could be used in animal models as an indicator of sensory ataxia due to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN). Over the years, gait analysis in in vivo studies has evolved from simple observations carried out by a trained operator to computerised systems with machine learning that allow the quantification of any variable of interest and the establishment of algorithms for behavioural classification. However, there is not a consensus on gait analysis use in CIPN animal models; therefore, we carried out a systematic review. Of 987 potentially relevant studies, 14 were included, in which different methods were analysed (observation, footprint and CatWalk\u2122). We presented the state-of-the-art of possible approaches to analyse sensory ataxia in rodent models, addressing advantages and disadvantages of different methods available. Semi-automated methods may be of interest when preventive or therapeutic strategies are evaluated, also considering their methodological simplicity and automaticity; up to now, only CatWalk\u2122 analysis has been tested. Future studies should expect that CIPN-affected animals tend to reduce hind paw support due to pain, allodynia or loss of sensation, and an increase in swing phase could or should be observed. Few available studies documented these impairments at the last time point, and only appeared later on respect to other earlier signs of CIPN (such as altered neurophysiological findings). For that reason, gait impairment could be interpreted as late repercussions of loss of sensory.",

        "Abstract": "Vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) is regarded as a possible target in cancer treatment. It is expressed in primary acute myeloid leukemia cells (AML), but the expression varies between patients and is highest for patients with a favorable prognosis after intensive chemotherapy. We therefore investigated the functional effects of two V-ATPase inhibitors (bafilomycin A1, concanamycin A) for primary AML cells derived from 80 consecutive patients. The V-ATPase inhibitors showed dose-dependent antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects that varied considerably between patients. A proteomic comparison of primary AML cells showing weak versus strong antiproliferative effects of V-ATPase inhibition showed a differential expression of proteins involved in intracellular transport/cytoskeleton functions, and an equivalent phosphoproteomic comparison showed a differential expression of proteins that regulate RNA processing/function together with increased activity of casein kinase 2. Patients with secondary AML, i.e., a heterogeneous subset with generally adverse prognosis and previous cytotoxic therapy, myeloproliferative neoplasia or myelodysplastic syndrome, were characterized by a strong antiproliferative effect of V-ATPase inhibition and also by a specific mRNA expression profile of V-ATPase interactome proteins. Furthermore, the V-ATPase inhibition altered the constitutive extracellular release of several soluble mediators (e.g., chemokines, interleukins, proteases, protease inhibitors), and increased mediator levels in the presence of AML-supporting bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells was then observed, especially for patients with secondary AML. Finally, animal studies suggested that the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin had limited toxicity, even when combined with cytarabine. To conclude, V-ATPase inhibition has antileukemic effects in AML, but this effect varies between patients.",

        "Abstract": "Animals tend to alternate between different choices, which requires the ability to remember recent choices. The Y-maze spontaneous alternation test is widely used in various animal models for assessing short-term memory, and its precise evaluation depends upon the accurate determination of the arm visit sequence. However, an objective method for defining arm visits is lacking owing to uncertainty regarding the extent to which an animal must go into the arm to be considered visited. Here, we conducted quantitative analyses on mice behavior in the Y-maze while systematically varying the arm visit threshold and assessed the effect of acute social isolation on spatial working memory. Our results revealed that 24-h social isolation significantly reduced spontaneous alternation rate when the arm threshold was set at the distal part of the arm. Furthermore, the memory of the recently visited arms faded away faster in the socially isolated mice. However, other behavioral factors were comparable to those of the group-housed mice, indicating a specific impairment of short-term memory. Our findings suggest that the location of arm visit threshold is critical for the precise evaluation of short-term memory, and our study provides a method for comprehensively and systematically assessing spontaneous alternation behavior in the Y-maze.",

        "Abstract": "The present study is designed to investigate the role of vagus nerve in the treatments of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the associated central nervous system disorders. An IBS animal model was established by giving acetic acid and chronic-acute stress (AA-CAS) treatment in adult male Wistar rats. Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) were performed to intervene the excitability of vagus nerve. Permeability of blood brain barrier (BBB) was measured and agonist and antagonist of \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR) were used to explore the relevant mechanisms. AA-CAS treatment resulted in abnormal fecal output, increased visceral sensitivity, depressive-like behaviors, and overexpression of inflammatory mediators, all of which were reversed by VNS treatment. The effects of VNS could also be observed when \u03b17nAChR agonist was applied. Whereas \u03b17nAChR antagonist (methyllycaconitine, MLA) reversed VNS's effects. Interestingly, VNS also reduced the increased permeability of blood brain barrier (BBB) following AA-CAS treatment in IBS rats. SDV treatment only show temporary efficacy on AA-CAS-induced symptoms and had no effect on the permeability of BBB. The intestinal abnormalities and depressive symptoms in IBS rats can be improved by VNS treatment. This positive effect of VNS was achieved through \u03b17nAChR-mediated inflammatory pathway and may also be associated with the decreased of BBB permeability.",

To date, the exact pathogenesis of IBS remains elusive, but is clearly multifactorial, including environmental and host factors. However, the management of patients with IBS is challenging and the current diagnostic and therapeutic modalities have unsatisfactory outcomes. Therefore, it is important to develop more effective methods to diagnose IBS early. Metabolomics studies the metabolites most closely related to patient characteristics, which can provide useful clinical biomarkers that can be applied to IBS and may open up new diagnostic approaches. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can play a role in improving symptoms and protecting target organs, but its mechanism needs to be studied in depth. In this review, based on PubMed/MEDLINE and other databases, we searched metabolomics studies related to IBS in the past 5\u00a0years, including those related to clinical studies and animal studies, as well as literatures on TCM interventions in IBS, to provide an updated overview of the application of metabolomics to the diagnosis and treatment of IBS and the improvement of IBS by TCM.",

We review recent preclinical and clinical evidence from animal studies and infant/child populations. Although further research is needed, growing evidence suggests that different functional nutrients affect the establishment and development of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and could have preventive and therapeutic use in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, more in-depth knowledge regarding the effect of nutrition on the MGBA during critical developmental windows may enable the prevention of later neurocognitive and behavioral disorders and allow the establishment of individualized nutrition-based programs that can be used from the prenatal to the early and middle stages of life.",

IBD etiology remains undefined but involves environmental factors, genetic predisposition, microbiota imbalance (dysbiosis) and mucosal immune defects. Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) injections have shown good efficacy in reducing intestinal inflammation in animal and human studies. However, their effect on tumor growth in CAC and their capacity to restore gut dysbiosis are not clear. The outcome of systemic administrations of in vitro expanded human intestinal MSCs (iMSCs) on tumor growth in vivo was evaluated using the AOM/DSS model of CAC in C57BL/6J mice. Innate and adaptive immune responses in blood, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and colonic tissue were analyzed by flow cytometry. Intestinal microbiota composition was evaluated by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. iMSCs significantly inhibited colitis and intestinal tumor development, reducing IL-6 and COX-2 expression, and IL-6/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt signaling. iMSCs decreased colonic immune cell infiltration, and partly restored intestinal monocyte homing and differentiation. iMSC administration increased the numbers of Tregs and IFN-\u03b3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the MLNs while decreasing the IL-4<sup>+</sup>Th2 response. It also ameliorated intestinal dysbiosis in CAC mice, increasing diversity and Bacillota/Bacteroidota ratio, as well as Akkermansia abundance, while reducing Alistipes and Turicibacter, genera associated with inflammation.

        "Abstract": "Endometriosis is a chronic gynaecological condition, often causing gastrointestinal symptoms and misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Endometriosis guidelines do not formally endorse dietary changes and little is known about how they are self-managed. The objective of this study is to understand nutritional practices and management of gut symptoms in people with endometriosis. Participants were recruited as part of a larger survey study via endometriosis support groups on social media. Eligibility criteria were: a self-reported physician-led diagnosis of endometriosis, over 18 years old and residing in the United Kingdom (UK). Semi-structured interviews were undertaken virtually via Zoom using a predefined interview guide. All interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. 10 people with endometriosis were interviewed. All had made individual dietary changes to manage their gut-related endometriosis symptoms. Dietary changes were made based on advice from social media support, books, websites or professionals other than dietitians. Changes included the restriction and exclusion of multiple essential food groups, including dairy, grains (primarily gluten), vegetables, fruits, and animal products. These changes impacted participants' weight, nutritional status and relationship with food. Four strong themes were identified: 1) impact of pain 2) severe and unpredictable gut symptoms 3) dietary changes and their impact 4) seeking support for dietetic intervention. A common thread underlying and linking these four main themes was the feeling of being dismissed, care being delayed and lack of support. Overall the long delay waiting for a diagnosis, surgery and, at times, the re-occurrence of symptoms post-surgery led to unsupported trial and error with modifiable lifestyle factors, including diet. Overall, participants demonstrated some patterns of restrictive eating behaviour and wanted more professional support to help manage their endometriosis-related gut symptoms. This highlights the need for dietitians to be involved in endometriosis care to help alleviate gut symptoms, whilst ensuring nutritional adequacy and offering weight management support where required.",

        "Abstract": "Epidemic Intelligence (EI) encompasses all activities related to early identification, verification, analysis, assessment, and investigation of health threats. It integrates an indicator-based (IBS) component using systematically collected surveillance data, and an event-based component (EBS), using non-official, non-verified, non-structured data from multiple sources. We described current EI practices in Europe by conducting a survey of national Public Health (PH) and Animal Health (AH) agencies. We included generic questions on the structure, mandate and scope of the institute, on the existence and coordination of EI activities, followed by a section where respondents provided a description of EI activities for three diseases out of seven disease models. Out of 81 gatekeeper agencies from 41 countries contacted, 34 agencies (42%) from 26 (63%) different countries responded, out of which, 32 conducted EI activities. Less than half (15/32; 47%) had teams dedicated to EI activities and 56% (18/34) had Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in place. On a national level, a combination of IBS and EBS was the most common data source. Most respondents monitored the epidemiological situation in bordering countries, the rest of Europe and the world. EI systems were heterogeneous across countries and diseases. National IBS activities strongly relied on mandatory laboratory-based surveillance systems. The collection, analysis and interpretation of IBS information was performed manually for most disease models. Depending on the disease, some respondents did not have any EBS activity. Most respondents conducted signal assessment manually through expert review. Cross-sectoral collaboration was heterogeneous. More than half of the responding institutes collaborated on various levels (data sharing, communication, etc.) with neighbouring countries and/or international structures, across most disease models. Our findings emphasise a notable engagement in EI activities across PH and AH institutes of Europe, but opportunities exist for better integration, standardisation, and automatization of these efforts. A strong reliance on traditional IBS and laboratory-based surveillance systems, emphasises the key role of in-country laboratories networks. EI activities may benefit particularly from investments in cross-border collaboration, the development of methods that can automatise signal assessment in both IBS and EBS data, as well as further investments in the collection of EBS data beyond scientific literature and mainstream media.",

We hypothesized that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR/NR3C1) might cause chromatin circadian misalignment in the colon epithelium. We observed significantly decreased core circadian gene <i>Nr1d1</i> in water avoidance stressed (WAS) BALB/c colon epithelium, like in IBS patients.

        "Abstract": "Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) is a particular type of IBS, with symptom onset after an acute episode of infectious gastroenteritis. Despite infectious disease resolution and clearance of the inciting pathogen agent, 10% of patients will develop PI-IBS. In susceptible individuals, the exposure to pathogenic organisms leads to a marked shift in the gut microbiota with prolonged changes in host-microbiota interactions. These changes can affect the gut-brain axis and the visceral sensitivity, disrupting the intestinal barrier, altering neuromuscular function, triggering persistent low inflammation, and sustaining the onset of IBS symptoms. There is no specific treatment strategy for PI-IBS. Different drug classes can be used to treat PI-IBS similar to patients with IBS in general, guided by their clinical symptoms. This review summarizes the current evidence for microbial dysbiosis in PI-IBS and analyzes the available data regarding the role of the microbiome in mediating the central and peripheral dysfunctions that lead to IBS symptoms. It also discusses the current state of evidence on therapies targeting the microbiome in the management of PI-IBS. The results of microbial modulation strategies used in relieving IBS symptomatology are encouraging. Several studies on PI-IBS animal models reported promising results. However, published data that describe the efficacy and safety of microbial targeted therapy in PI-IBS patients are scarce. Future research is required.",

        "Abstract": "Ecological associations between wild felids and parasites from the Taeniidae family are related to predator-prey interactions, where felids act as definitive hosts while their prey, herbivores and/or omnivores, act as intermediate hosts. In the Atlantic Forest, six neotropical felid species coexist in sympatry, but the ecological parasite-host interactions remain poorly studied. Taenia omissa is a tapeworm that parasitizes cougars (Puma concolor) as its only definitive host and their ungulate prey as intermediate hosts. The aim of this study was to identify tapeworms present in road-killed fauna using both molecular and morphological characteristics and their predator-prey relationship. Adult tapeworms found in a cougar, a jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi), and two ocelots (Leopardus pardalis); and metacestodes found in a red brocket deer (Mazama americana) and a wild guinea pig (Cavia aperea) were analyzed. Through morphological analysis of rostellar hooks and molecular analysis of the mitochondrial genetic marker cox1, Taenia omissa adult individuals were identified in the cougar, and metacestodes in the red brocket deer, proving the existence of a full host-parasite life cycle in the Atlantic Forest region. This new report reveals the southernmost record of T. omissa and broadens its geographic distribution. In addition, isolates of the Taenia genus divergent from those described so far in molecular databases were reported and suggested a wild cycle that involves the jaguarundi and agouti (Dasyprocta asarae) as definitive and intermediate hosts, respectively. These results highlight the complexity of the tapeworm population in the region and the need to study it with both morphological and molecular approaches.",

Poloxamer 407\u00ae was used as biocompatible biomaterial to embed hMSCs. The developed hydrogel containing 20\u00a0% (w/w) of polymer resulted in the best formulation with respect to physical, mechanical, morphological and biological properties. Its high swelling capacity confirmed the hydrogel's capacity to absorb wounds' exudate. LIVE/DEAD\u00ae assay confirm that hMSCs remained viable for at least 48\u00a0h when loaded into the hydrogels. Adding increasing concentrations of hMSCs-loaded hydrogel to the epithelium did not affect keratinocytes' viability and healing capacity and all wound area was closed in less than one day. Our study opens opportunities to exploit poloxamer hydrogels as cell carriers for the treatment of skin superficial wound.",

Most infections occurring in Europe are due to the endemic several subtypes of genotype 3, through the consumption of raw or undercooked pork, observing a genotype geographical distribution pattern among countries Because of global changes in the pig and pork trading markets, subtype distribution might vary. We aimed to evaluate the temporal distribution of HEV genotypes in patients from southern Spain with acute hepatitis to determine whether these changes were related to the pig import trade during the study period between 2018 and 2022. Prospective longitudinal study including patients with acute hepatitis from southern Spain between 2018 and 2022. HEV RNA and antibodies was tested in all patients. In patients with detectable HEV RNA, genotype was obtained. To determine the number of imported pigs and their origins, we checked the official data from the Spanish statistics on international trade of Spanish Minister of Industry during by country of origin during the same study period. A total of 659 patients with acute hepatitis were included in the study. Among them, 162 (24.5%) had at least one marker (IgM or RNA) of acute HEV infection. Among the 71 patients with detectable viral RNA, genotypes could be obtained for 58 (81.6%). The most prevalent HEV genotype was 3f (<i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a048; 78.6%), showing a decreasing prevalence of over time, from 100% in 2018 to 70.6% in 2022. Since 2021, the emergence of other genotypes has been determined. A significant increase in the number of animals imported was observed since the beginning of the study. Denmark experienced a significant rise, from 0.03% in 2018 of total imports to 10.4% in 2022. HEV molecular diversity is changing in Spain, could be linked to changes in fattening pig import origin.",

        "Title": "Food biodiversity and total and cause-specific mortality in 9 European countries: An analysis of a prospective cohort study.",
        "Abstract": "Food biodiversity, encompassing the variety of plants, animals, and other organisms consumed as food and drink, has intrinsic potential to underpin diverse, nutritious diets and improve Earth system resilience. Dietary species richness (DSR), which is recommended as a crosscutting measure of food biodiversity, has been positively associated with the micronutrient adequacy of diets in women and young children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the relationships between DSR and major health outcomes have yet to be assessed in any population. We examined the associations between DSR and subsequent total and cause-specific mortality among 451,390 adults enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study (1992 to 2014, median follow-up: 17 years), free of cancer, diabetes, heart attack, or stroke at baseline. Usual dietary intakes were assessed at recruitment with country-specific dietary questionnaires (DQs). DSR of an individual's yearly diet was calculated based on the absolute number of unique biological species in each (composite) food and drink. Associations were assessed by fitting multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models. In the EPIC cohort, 2 crops (common wheat and potato) and 2 animal species (cow and pig) accounted for approximately 45% of self-reported total dietary energy intake [median (P10-P90): 68 (40 to 83) species consumed per year]. Overall, higher DSR was inversely associated with all-cause mortality rate. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing total mortality in the second, third, fourth, and fifth (highest) quintiles (Qs) of DSR to the first (lowest) Q indicate significant inverse associations, after stratification by sex, age, and study center and adjustment for smoking status, educational level, marital status, physical activity, alcohol intake, and total energy intake, Mediterranean diet score, red and processed meat intake, and fiber intake [HR (95% CI): 0.91 (0.88 to 0.94), 0.80 (0.76 to 0.83), 0.69 (0.66 to 0.72), and 0.63 (0.59 to 0.66), respectively; PWald < 0.001 for trend]. Absolute death rates among participants in the highest and lowest fifth of DSR were 65.4 and 69.3 cases/10,000 person-years, respectively. Significant inverse associations were also observed between DSR and deaths due to cancer, heart disease, digestive disease, and respiratory disease. An important study limitation is that our findings were based on an observational cohort using self-reported dietary data obtained through single baseline food frequency questionnaires (FFQs); thus, exposure misclassification and residual confounding cannot be ruled out. In this large Pan-European cohort, higher DSR was inversely associated with total and cause-specific mortality, independent of sociodemographic, lifestyle, and other known dietary risk factors. Our findings support the potential of food (species) biodiversity as a guiding principle of sustainable dietary recommendations and food-based dietary guidelines.",

A screening of Ebola glycoprotein (GP)-collectins interactions revealed the specific interaction of human surfactant protein D (hSP-D), a lectin expressed in lung and liver, two compartments where Ebola was found in vivo. Further analyses have demonstrated an involvement of hSP-D in the enhancement of virus infection in several in vitro models. Similar effects were observed for porcine SP-D (pSP-D). In addition, both hSP-D and pSP-D interacted with Reston virus (RESTV) GP and enhanced pseudoviral infection in pulmonary cells.

In this study, we used the published sequence of the nucleoprotein (N) of the recently identified Swine Orthopneumovirus (SOV) to express and purify SOV N as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. This protein was purified as nanorings and used to set up an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which was used to analyse the presence of anti-pneumovirus N antibodies in swine sera. Sera collected from different pig farms in the West of France and from specific pathogen free piglets before colostrum uptake showed indirectly that a pneumovirus is circulating in pig populations with some variations between animals. Piglets before colostrum uptake were sero-negative for anti-pneumovirus antibodies while most of the other pigs showed positivity. Interestingly, in two farms presenting respiratory clinical signs and negative or under control for some common respiratory pathogens, pigs were detected positive for anti-pneumovirus antibodies. Globally, anti-pneumovirus N antibody concentrations were variable between and within farms. Further studies will aim to isolate the circulating virus and determine its potential pathogenicity. SOV could potentially become a new member of the porcine respiratory complex, important on its own or in association with other viral and bacterial micro-organisms.",

        "Abstract": "The causes of gastrointestinal complaints in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remain poorly understood. Altered nerve function has emerged as an important pathogenic factor as IBS mucosal biopsy supernatants consistently activate enteric and sensory neurons. We investigated the neurally active molecular components of such supernatants from patients with IBS and quiescent ulcerative colitis (UC). Effects of supernatants from 7 healthy controls (HC), 20 IBS and 12 UC patients on human and guinea pig submucous neurons were studied with neuroimaging techniques. We identify differentially expressed proteins with proteome analysis. Nerve activation by IBS supernatants was prevented by the protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1) antagonist SCHE79797. UC supernatants also activated enteric neurons through protease dependent mechanisms but without PAR1 involvement. Proteome analysis of the supernatants identified 204 proteins, among them 17 proteases as differentially expressed between IBS, UC and HC. Of those the four proteases elastase 3a, chymotrypsin C, proteasome subunit type beta-2 and an unspecified isoform of complement C3 were significantly more abundant in IBS compared to HC and UC supernatants. Of eight proteases, which were upregulated in IBS, the combination of elastase 3a, cathepsin L and proteasome alpha subunit-4 showed the highest prediction accuracy of 98% to discriminate between IBS and HC groups. Elastase synergistically potentiated the effects of histamine and serotonin-the two other main neuroactive substances in the IBS supernatants. A serine protease inhibitor isolated from the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705 (SERPINBL), known to inhibit elastase-like proteases, prevented nerve activation by IBS supernatants. Proteases in IBS and UC supernatants were responsible for nerve activation. Our data demonstrate that proteases, particularly those signalling through neuronal PAR1, are biomarker candidates for IBS, and protease profiling may be used to characterise IBS.",

Emerging evidence links the activation of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) receptors with stress-related alterations of gastric and colonic motor function. Therefore, we investigated the effect of peripheral CRF peptide and water avoidance stress (WAS) on upper and lower GI transit in guinea pigs. Dosages 1, 3, and 10 \u03bcg/kg of CRF were injected intraperitoneally (IP) in fasted guinea pigs 30 minutes prior to the intragastric administration of charcoal mix to measure upper GI transit. Colonic transits in non-fasted guinea pigs were assessed by fecal pellet output assay after above IP CRF doses. Blockade of CRF receptors by Astressin, and its effect on GI transit was also analyzed. Guinea pigs were subjected to WAS to measure gastrocolonic transit in different sets of experiments. Dose 10 \u03bcg/kg of CRF significantly inhibited upper GI transit. In contrast, there was dose dependent acceleration of the colonic transit. Remarkably, pretreatment of astressin significantly reverses the effect of CRF peptide on GI transit. WAS significantly increase colonic transit, but failed to accelerate upper GI transit. Peripheral CRF peptide significantly suppressed upper GI transit and accelerated colon transit, while central CRF involved WAS stimulated only colonic transit. Therefore, peripheral CRF could be utilized to establish the animal model of overlap syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "The development of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) antibody-based assays is important for detecting infected animals, confirming previous virus exposure, and monitoring sow herd immunity. However, the potential cross-reactivity among porcine coronaviruses is a major concern for the development of pathogen-specific assays. In this study, we used serum samples (<i>n</i> = 792) from pigs of precisely known infection status and a multiplex fluorescent microbead-based immunoassay and/or enzyme-linked immunoassay platform to characterize the antibody response to PEDV whole-virus (WV) particles and recombinant polypeptides derived from the four PEDV structural proteins, i.e., spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E). Antibody assay cutoff values were selected to provide 100% diagnostic specificity for each target. The earliest IgG antibody response, mainly directed against S1 polypeptides, was observed at days 7 to 10 postinfection. With the exception of nonreactive protein E, we observed similar antibody ontogenies and patterns of seroconversion for S1, N, M, and WV antigens. Recombinant S1 provided the best diagnostic sensitivity, regardless of the PEDV strain, with no cross-reactivity detected against transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), or porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) pig antisera. The WV particles showed some cross-reactivity to TGEV Miller and TGEV Purdue antisera, while N protein presented some cross-reactivity to TGEV Miller. The M protein was highly cross-reactive to TGEV and PRCV antisera. Differences in the antibody responses to specific PEDV structural proteins have important implications in the development and performance of antibody assays for the diagnosis of PEDV enteric disease.",

        "Abstract": "Malfunctions of enteric neurons are believed to play an important role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Our aim was to investigate whether neuronal activity in biopsies from IBS patients is altered in comparison to healthy controls (HC). Activity of human submucous neurons in response to electrical nerve stimulation and local application of nicotine or a mixture of histamine, serotonin, tryptase, and TNF-\u03b1 (IBS-cocktail) was recorded in biopsies from 17 HC and 35 IBS patients with the calcium-sensitive-dye Fluo-4 AM. The concentrations of the mediators resembeled those found in biopsy supernatants or blood. Neuronal activity in guinea-pig submucous neurons was studied with the voltage-sensitive-dye di-8-ANEPPS. Activity in submucous ganglia in response to nicotine or electrical nerve stimulation was not different between HC and IBS patients (P = 0.097 or P = 0.448). However, the neuronal response after application of the IBS-cocktail was significantly decreased (P = 0.039) independent of whether diarrhea (n = 12), constipation (n = 5) or bloating (n = 5) was the predominant symptom. In agreement with this we found that responses of submucous ganglia conditioned by overnight incubation with IBS mucosal biopsy supernatant to spritz application of this supernatant was significantly reduced (P = 0.019) when compared to incubation with HC supernatant. We demonstrated for the first time reduced neuronal responses in mucosal IBS biopsies to an IBS mediator cocktail. While excitability to classical stimuli of enteric neurons was comparable to HC, the activation by the IBS-cocktail was decreased. This was very likely due to desensitization to mediators constantly released by mucosal and immune cells in the gut wall of IBS patients.",

Our in vitro studies in guinea-pig colon have indicated that the cascade pathway of neuronal tachykinergic NK3 receptors and NK2 receptors on peptide YY (PYY)-containing endocrine L cells represents an endogenous modulator system for 5-HT release from EC cells and that melatonin, endogenous tachykinins and PYY play important roles in modulation of the release of 5-HT from EC cells via the endogenous NK2/NK3 receptor cascade system. This review aims at examining the potential role of the endogenous tachykinergic NK2/NK3 receptor cascade system controlling the release of 5-HT from EC cells, with special attention being paid to the pathophysiology of gut disorders including IBS.",

        "Abstract": "There are limited therapeutic options available for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). We tested the effects of Atractylodes japonica rhizome, a perennial plant native to North Asia, on both upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) motility in guinea pigs. The extract of A. japonica rhizome was administered orally at different doses to test its effects on upper GI motility as determined from charcoal transit in native guinea pigs and in guinea pigs pretreated with thyrotropin-releasing hormone or mustard oil. Regarding its effect on lower GI motility, the removed guinea pig colon was suspended in a chamber containing Krebs-Henseleit solution and the transit time of artificial feces was measured with various dilutions of the extract. As for in vivo assay, weight and number of fecal pellets expelled were determined under the same drug preparation used in upper GI motility experiment. The extract of A. japonica rhizome had no significant effect on upper GI motility in either normal or altered physiological states. However, the extract increased colonic transit time in the in vitro model. In the fecal expulsion study, the cumulative weight and number of pellets did not differ significantly between the control group and groups treated with the extracts. In the animals pretreated in vivo with thyrotropin-releasing hormone, however, the weight and number of fecal pellets were sig-nificantly decreased in animals treated with 300 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg doses of extract. Our findings suggest that the extract of A. japonica rhizome can be a potential agent for IBS-D.",

        "Title": "Dual effectiveness of Flaxseed in constipation and diarrhea: Possible mechanism.",
        "Abstract": "This study was planned to assess pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of Flaxseed in constipation and diarrhea. The oil and mucilage of Flaxseeds were studied for their laxative, and antidiarrheal activities in mice. The mechanisms of laxative and antidiarrheal activities were further studied using the isolated tissue preparations (rabbit jejunum and guinea-pig ileum) immersed in Tyrode\u05f3s solution maintained at 37\u00b0C and aerated with carbogen gas. Isotonic responses were measured on spontaneously contracting isolated jejunum and guinea-pig ileum preparations. Oral administration of Flaxseed oil (30 and 70mg/kg, orally) and mucilage (1 and 2.5g/kg, orally) caused dose-dependent increase in wet feces in mice. The spasmogenic effect of Flaxseed oil was partially blocked by pyrilamine (p<0.05) and atropine (p<0.01) in isolated rabbit jejunum whereas atropine completely blocked the effect of Flaxseed mucilage on isolated guinea-pig ileum. When studied for its antidiarrheal effect, Flaxseed oil reduced the castor oil-induced diarrheal score by 49.35% and 84.41% and intestinal secretions by 19% and 33.62% at the oral doses of 100 and 300mg/kg respectively. In isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, Flaxseed oil produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both spontaneous and low K(+) (25mM) -induced contractions in rabbit jejunum. The inhibitory effect against low K(+) was most sensitive to tetra-ethylammonium chloride, a non-specific K(+) channel blocker, followed by glibenclamide, a partial ATP-dependent K(+) channels blocker and 4-Aminopyridine, a voltage gated K(+)-channel blocker. Our results indicate that Flaxseed oil and mucilage exhibit laxative activity, mediated primarily through cholinergic pathway with weak histaminergic effect component evident in Flaxseed oil, which also showed antidiarrheal activity, mediated possibly through K(+) channels activation. Thus this study rationalizes the medicinal use of Flaxseed in both the constipation and diarrhea with sound mechanistic basis.",

        "Abstract": "Numerous methods have been developed over the last decade to predict allelic identity at unobserved loci between pairs of chromosome segments along the genome. These loci are often unobserved positions tested for the presence of quantitative trait loci (QTL). The main objective of this study was to understand from a theoretical standpoint the relation between linkage disequilibrium (LD) and allelic identity prediction when using haplotypes for fine mapping of QTL. In addition, six allelic identity predictors (AIP) were also compared in this study to determine which one performed best in theory and application. A criterion based on a simple measure of matrix distance was used to study the relation between LD and allelic identity prediction when using haplotypes. The consistency of this criterion with the accuracy of QTL localization, another criterion commonly used to compare AIP, was evaluated on a set of real chromosomes. For this set of chromosomes, the criterion was consistent with the mapping accuracy of a simulated QTL with either low or high effect. As measured by the matrix distance, the best AIP for QTL mapping were those that best captured LD between a tested position and a QTL. Moreover the matrix distance between a tested position and a QTL was shown to decrease for some AIP when LD increased. However, the matrix distance for AIP with continuous predictions in the [0,1] interval was algebraically proven to decrease less rapidly up to a lower bound with increasing LD in the simplest situations, than the discrete predictor based on identity by state between haplotypes (IBS hap), for which there was no lower bound. The expected LD between haplotypes at a tested position and alleles at a QTL is a quantity that increases naturally when the tested position gets closer to the QTL. This behavior was demonstrated with pig and unrelated human chromosomes. When the density of markers is high, and therefore LD between adjacent loci can be assumed to be high, the discrete predictor IBS hap is recommended since it predicts allele identity correctly when taking LD into account.",

We previously showed that mucosal biopsy supernatants from IBS patients activated enteric and visceral afferent neurons. We tested the hypothesis that visceral sensitivity is linked to the degree of neuronal activation. Normo- and hypersensitive IBS patients were distinguished by their discomfort/pain threshold to rectal balloon distension with a barostat. Using potentiometric and Ca(2+) dye imaging, we recorded the response of guinea-pig enteric submucous and mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, respectively, to mucosal biopsy supernatants from normosensitive (n\u00a0=\u00a012 tested in enteric neurons, n\u00a0=\u00a09 tested in DRG) and hypersensitive IBS patients (n\u00a0=\u00a09, tested in both types of neurons). In addition, we analysed the association between neuronal activation and individual discomfort/pain pressure thresholds. The IBS supernatants evoked Ca(2+) transients in DRG neurons and spike discharge in submucous neurons. Submucous and DRG neurons showed significantly stronger responses to supernatants from hypersensitive IBS patients as reflected by higher spike frequency or stronger [Ca(2+)]i transients in a larger proportion of neurons. The neuroindex as a product of spike frequency or [Ca(2+)]i transients and proportion of responding neurons correlated significantly with the individual discomfort/pain thresholds of the IBS patients. Supernatants from hypersensitive IBS patients caused stronger activation of enteric and DRG neurons. The level of activation correlated with the individual discomfort/pain threshold pressure values. These findings support our hypothesis that visceral sensitivity is linked to activation of peripheral neurons by biopsy supernatants.",

To address this, injectable IbS loaded PEGylated gelatin nanoparticles (PIG NPs) of size ~200nm and entrapment efficiency ~70%, providing sustained release in vitro were prepared by a modified two-step desolvation process. The developed nanomedicine, containing a range of IbS concentrations up to 1mg/mL proved to be non-toxic, hemocompatible and non-immunogenic, when tested through various in vitro assays and was reaffirmed by in vivo cytokine analysis. HPLC analysis of intravenously administered PIG NPs showed a sustained release of IbS for ~4days with improved bioavailability and pharmacokinetics when compared to bare IbS and IbS-loaded non-PEGylated GNPs. Histological analysis of liver and kidney revealed tissue integrity as in the control, indicating biocompatibility of PIG NPs. The results demonstrate improved plasma half-life of IbS when encapsulated within nanogelatin, thereby aiding reduction in its frequency of administration. In this preclinical study, improved plasma half-life of ibuprofen sodium was demonstrated when encapsulated within PEGylated gelatin nanoparticles of ~200 nm size, expected to lead to reduced frequency of administration in future clinical applications.",

        "Abstract": "We previously showed that colonic mucosal biopsy supernatants from patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) activate neurons of the human submucous plexus, an area with densely packed immune cells. Based on the concept that mucosa-nerve signaling is altered in IBS, we tested in this study whether the nerve sensitizing effect of IBS mucosal biopsy supernatants is more prominent in the submucous than myenteric plexus. Fast neuroimaging with the voltage-sensitive dye Di-8-ANEPPS was used to record activity of guinea-pig submucous and myenteric neurons after application of constipation (C)- and diarrhea (D)-IBS supernatants (three each) and four supernatants from healthy control subjects. Results are based on recordings from 4731 neurons. Control supernatants did not evoke significant responses in submucous or myenteric neurons. In contrast, all IBS supernatants evoked a significant spike discharge (median 3.6 Hz) in 46% of submucous neurons. This activation was significantly stronger than in the myenteric plexus where even twice the amount of supernatants evoked a lower spike frequency (median 2.1Hz) in only 8.5% of neurons. Pharmacological studies revealed serotonin, histamine, and proteases as components mediating neuronal activation. Individual application of these components revealed that only serotonin evoked a significantly stronger activation of submucous compared with myenteric neurons. Direct neuronal activation by IBS mucosal biopsy supernatants is primarily a feature of submucous rather than myenteric neurons. This is associated with a stronger excitation of submucous neurons by serotonin. The plexus-specific effects support the concept that altered mucosa-nerve signaling underlies disturbances in IBS.",

        "Abstract": "Mediators released in the mucosal milieu have been suggested to be involved in visceral hypersensitivity and abdominal pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, their impact on myenteric neurons remains unsettled. Mucosal biopsies were obtained from the descending colon of patients with IBS and controls. Mucosal mast cells were identified immunohistochemically. The impact of spontaneously released mucosal mediators on guinea pig electrically stimulated longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus (LMMP) preparations was assessed in vitro by means of selective receptor antagonists and inhibitors. Patients with IBS showed an increased mast cell count compared with controls. Application of mucosal mediators of IBS to LMMPs potentiated cholinergic twitch contractions, an effect directly correlated with mast cell counts. Enhanced contractions were inhibited by 50.3% with the prostaglandin D2 antagonist BW A868C, by 31.3% and 39% with the TRPV1 antagonists capsazepine and HC-030031, respectively, and by 60.5% with purinergic P2X antagonist pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid. Conversely, the serotonin1-4, histamine1-3, tachykinin1-3 receptor blockade, and serine protease inhibition had no significant effect. Colonic mucosal mediators from patients with IBS excite myenteric cholinergic motor neurons. These effects were correlated with mast cell counts and mediated by activation of prostanoid receptors, TRPV1, and P2X receptors. These results support the role of mucosal inflammatory mediators and mast cell activation in altered motor function of IBS.",

        "Abstract": "Linaclotide has been proposed as a treatment for the same gastrointestinal indications for which lubiprostone has been approved, chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. Stressors damage the epithelial cell barrier and cellular homeostasis leading to loss of these functions. Effects of active linaclotide on repair of barrier and cell function in pig jejunum after ischemia and in T84 cells after treatment with proinflammatory cytokines, interferon-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 were examined. Comparison with effects of lubiprostone, known to promote repair of barrier function was carried out. In ischemia-damaged pig jejunum, using measurements of transepithelial resistance, (3)H-mannitol fluxes, short-circuit current (Cl(-) secretion) and occludin localization, active linaclotide failed to effectively promote repair of the epithelial barrier or recovery of short-circuit current, whereas lubiprostone promoted barrier repair and increased short-circuit current. In control pig jejunum, 1 \u03bcM linaclotide and 1 \u03bcM lubiprostone both caused similar increases in short-circuit current (Cl(-) secretion). In T84 cells, using measurements of transepithelial resistance, fluxes of fluorescent macromolecules, occludin and mitochondrial membrane potential, active linaclotide was virtually ineffective against damage caused by interferon-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, while lubiprostone protected or promoted repair of epithelial barrier and cell function. Barrier protection/repair by lubiprostone was inhibited by methadone, a ClC-2 inhibitor. Linaclotide, but not lubiprostone increased [cGMP]i as expected and [Ca(2+)]i and linaclotide depolarized while lubiprostone hyperpolarized the T84 plasma membrane potential suggesting that lubiprostone may lead to greater cellular stability compared to linaclotide. In T84 cells, as found with linaclotide but not with lubiprostone, transepithelial resistance was slightly but significantly decreased by guanylin, STa and 8-bromo cGMP and fluorescent dextran fluxes were increased by guanylin. However the physiological implications of these small but statistically significant changes remain unclear. Considering the physiological importance of epithelial barrier function and cell integrity and the known impact of stressors, the finding that lubiprostone, but not active linaclotide, exhibits the additional distinct property of effective protection or repair of the epithelial barrier and cell function after stress suggests potential clinical importance for patients with impaired or compromised barrier function such as might occur in IBS.",

        "Abstract": "The intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs) in the intestine are the first neurons of intrinsic reflexes. Action potential currents of IPANs flow partly through calcium channels, which could feasibly be targeted by pregabalin. The aim was to determine whether pregabalin-sensitive \u03b12\u03b41 subunits associate with calcium channels of IPANs and whether \u03b12\u03b41 subunit ligands influence IPAN neuronal properties. We used intracellular electrophysiological recording and in situ hybridisation to investigate calcium channel subunit expression in guinea-pig enteric neurons. The \u03b1 subunits of N (\u03b11B) and R (\u03b11E) type calcium channels, and the auxiliary \u03b12\u03b41 subunit, were expressed by IPANs. This is the first discovery of the \u03b12\u03b41 subunit in enteric neurons; we therefore investigated its functional role, by determining effects of the \u03b12\u03b41 subunit ligand, pregabalin, that inhibits currents carried by channels incorporating this subunit. Pregabalin (10\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009L(-1)) reduced the action potential duration. The effect was not increased with increase in concentration to 100\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009L(-1). If N channels were first blocked by \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA (0.5\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009L(-1)), pregabalin had no effect on the residual inward calcium current. Reduction of the calcium current by pregabalin substantially inhibited the after-hyperpolarising potential (AHP) and increased neuron excitability. Intrinsic primary afferent neurons express functional N (\u03b11B) channel-forming subunits that are associated with \u03b12\u03b41 modulatory subunits and are inhibited by pregabalin, plus functional R (\u03b11E) channels that are not sensitive to binding of pregabalin to \u03b12\u03b4 subunits. The positive effects of pregabalin in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients might be partly mediated by its effect on enteric neurons.",

        "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal (GI) disorder characterized by chronic abdominal discomfort, including pain, bloating and changes in bowel habits. The exact cause of IBS is not entirely understood. Recent studies have shown that IBS may be associated with altered serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) levels within the GI tract. About 90% of 5-HT in the human body is produced and stored in enterochromaffin (EC) cells that reside in the mucosal layer of the intestine. Measurements of serotonin availability locally in the mucosa can provide insight on the functionality of these cells and potentially the pathophysiology of the disease. In this study, we used continuous amperometry with a diamond microelectrode to record serotonin levels in vitro in the ileum mucosa as an oxidation current. The boron-doped diamond (BDD) microelectrode is quite practical for these measurements because if its low background signal, low sensitivity to solution pH changes, and excellent resistance to fouling by adsorbed serotonin oxidation reaction products. In fact, the measurements are only possible because of the unique properties of diamond. We present electrochemical data that demonstrate the diamond microelectrode's utility for assessment of enterochromaffin cell function. Confirmation that the oxidation current was associated with indogenous serotonin release came from pharmacological studies. We are hopeful that these types of in vitro electrochemical measurements will lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of IBS.",

        "Title": "Cardiovascular safety profile of MA-2029, a novel motilin receptor antagonist.",
        "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the cardiovascular effect of MA-2029, a selective motilin receptor antagonist highly expected for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). MA-2029 inhibited the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) current at 100 microg/ml, but shortened action potential duration (APD) in isolated guinea pig papillary muscles at 10 and 100 microg/ml and the corrected QT (QTc) interval after oral administration of 30 and 300 mg/kg in conscious telemetered dogs. The discrepancy was probably caused by blockade of the Ca(2+) channel because MA-2029 inhibited the Ca(2+) current in isolated guinea pig myocytes. MA-2029 at 100 microg/ml also decreased the maximum rising velocity and action potential amplitude in the action potential study, indicating that MA-2029 has Na(+) channel blocking potential. In the cardiovascular study, MA-2029 at 30 mg/kg induced slight cardiovascular changes such as hypotension, QTc shortening, and PR prolongation possibly caused by Ca(2+) channel blockade. The plasma concentration at 4 hr after 30 mg/kg administration was 2.10 microg/ml, 200-fold higher than the effective concentration of MA-2029 as a motilin receptor antagonist. These results suggest that MA-2029 has sufficient cardiovascular safety although it inhibits multiple ion channels at supra-effective concentrations. On the other hand, cisapride, an effective IBS drug, showed clear hERG inhibition and APD prolongation at 100 ng/ml. Cisapride exhibited a narrow safety margin because it caused QT prolongation potential even at the therapeutic concentration. In conclusion, MA-2029 is a novel drug highly expected for the treatment of IBS with lower cardiovascular risk than cisapride.",

        "Title": "Novel pharmacology: asimadoline, a kappa-opioid agonist, and visceral sensation.",
        "Abstract": "Asimadoline is a potent kappa-opioid receptor agonist with a diaryl acetamide structure. It has high affinity for the kappa receptor, with IC(50) of 5.6 nmol L(-1) (guinea pig) and 1.2 nmol L(-1) (human recombinant), and high selectively with kappa : micro : delta binding ratios of 1 : 501 : 498 in human recombinant receptors. It acts as a complete agonist in in vitro assay. Asimadoline reduced sensation in response to colonic distension at subnoxious pressures in healthy volunteers and in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients without alteration of colonic compliance. Asimadoline reduced satiation and enhanced the postprandial gastric volume (in female volunteers). However, there were no significant effects on gastrointestinal transit, colonic compliance, fasting or postprandial colonic tone. In a clinical trial in 40 patients with functional dyspepsia (Rome II), asimadoline did not significantly alter satiation or symptoms over 8 weeks. However, asimadoline, 0.5 mg, significantly decreased satiation in patients with higher postprandial fullness scores, and daily postprandial fullness severity (over 8 weeks); the asimadoline 1.0 mg group was borderline significant. In a clinical trial in patients with IBS, average pain 2 h post-on-demand treatment with asimadoline was not significantly reduced. Post hoc analyses suggest that asimadoline was effective in mixed IBS. In a 12-week study in 596 patients, chronic treatment with 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg asimadoline was associated with adequate relief of pain and discomfort, improvement in pain score and number of pain-free days in patients with IBS-D. The 1.0 mg dose was also efficacious in IBS-alternating. There were also weeks with significant reduction in bowel frequency and urgency. Asimadoline has been well tolerated in human trials to date.",

        "Title": "Pharmacology and metabolism of renzapride : a novel therapeutic agent for the potential treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Renzapride (ATL-1251), a novel benzamide, is currently under clinical development for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Previous in vitro and in vivo experimental studies have characterized renzapride as a full serotonin 5-HT(4) receptor agonist on the gut and a 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist. Clinical studies have confirmed the therapeutic efficacy, tolerability and safety of renzapride in patients with constipation-predominant IBS. This study set out to characterize the pharmacological profile of renzapride and its potential metabolic products at both 5-HT and other monoamine receptors in the gut. The affinity of renzapride, its (+) and (-) enantiomers, and its primary metabolite, renzapride N-oxide and its enantiomers, for serotonin receptors was assessed by means of in vitro radioligand binding inhibition studies. After membranes prepared from animal tissue or membranes of cell lines transfected with cloned human receptors had been incubated with radiolabelled ligand with high affinity for a specific receptor, renzapride was added to competitively inhibit this binding. Levels of bound radioligand were measured by filtration and counting of the bound radioactivity. In instances where >50% inhibition of radioligand binding had occurred, the inhibition constant (K(i)) was calculated. Metabolism of renzapride by liver microsomes was assessed by incubating 10 micromol/L renzapride with human liver microsome samples for 60 minutes at 37 degrees C. After the reaction was stopped, the samples were centrifuged and the supernatant analysed for metabolites by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The potential inhibitory effects of renzapride on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes were assessed by incubating renzapride at various concentrations over a 1-500 micromol/L concentration range with microsomes genetically engineered to express a single CYP. Renzapride was selective for serotonergic receptors and, in particular, had high affinity for human 5-HT(3) and guinea-pig 5-HT(4) receptors (K(i) 17 and 477 nm, respectively). Inhibitory properties at 5-HT(2B) receptors were also identified for renzapride, as well as some affinity for 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors. Renzapride N-oxide and its enantiomers demonstrated much lower affinity for all 5-HT receptors compared with renzapride. Renzapride was metabolized by liver microsomes to a limited extent and there was no significant non-microsomal metabolism of renzapride. Renzapride did not inhibit the major CYP drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4 at concentrations consistent with use in a clinical setting. These results confirm and extend earlier studies in animal and human receptors that show renzapride is a potent and generally full 5-HT(4) receptor agonist and 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist. The results reported in the present study indicate that the metabolites of renzapride are minor and are unlikely to contribute to its therapeutic profile or lead to interaction of renzapride with other drugs that inhibit the major drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver at therapeutic doses. These data contribute to the understanding of the pharmacological actions and metabolic fate of renzapride in vivo.",

        "Abstract": "Stressful life events and infections contribute to gut disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We used a pig model to analyse whether this could be linked to altered mediator sensitivity of the epithelial lining. Uninfected control pigs or pigs with subclinical Salmonella (S.) typhimurium DT 104 infection were killed either without (ConRest, InfRest) or with prior 8-h transportation (ConTrans, InfTrans). Short-circuit current (I(sc)), tissue conductance (G(t)) and release of mast cell mediators were monitored in isolated colonic epithelia mounted in Ussing chambers. Epithelia were exposed to histamine (100 microM, mucosally), substance P (SP; 1 microM, serosally), calcimycin A23187 (1 microM, serosally) and theophylline (10 mM, bilaterally). Transepithelial flux of histamine and colonic activities of histamine N-methyltransferase (HMT) and diamine oxidase (DAO) were determined. S. infection decreased baseline I(sc), G(t) and histamine fluxes, while transportation had no effect on these values. Mucosal histamine increased I(sc) only in ConTrans pigs. This was not associated with increased mucosal-to-serosal flux of histamine but with a 2-fold increased DAO activity. Serosal SP increased I(sc) only in transported animals, but the increase was six times higher in ConTrans versus InfTrans pigs. Effectiveness of SP was not dependent on the release of histamine or prostaglandin D2. A23187 and theophylline elicited increases in I(sc) that were not different between treatments. Transportation stress facilitates secretory responses of the colonic epithelium to SP and luminal histamine. This is suppressed by subclinical S. infection. Effects of S. infection on porcine colon resemble, in part, the known effects of an oral S. endotoxin application.",

        "Abstract": "Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a major mediator of stress response in the brain-gut axis. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is presumed to be a disorder of the brain-gut link associated with exaggerated response to stress. We first showed that peripheral administration of CRH aggravated visceral sensorimotor function as well as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) response in IBS patients. We then administered alpha-helical CRH (alphahCRH), a non-selective CRH receptor antagonist among IBS patients. Electrical stimulation of the rectum induced significantly higher motility indices of the colon in IBS patients than in the controls. This response was significantly suppressed in IBS patients but not in the controls after administration of alphahCRH. Administration of alphahCRH induced a significant increase in the barostat bag volume of the controls but not in that of IBS patients. alphahCRH significantly reduced the ordinate scale of abdominal pain and anxiety evoked by electrical stimulation in IBS patients. Plasma ACTH and serum cortisol were generally not suppressed by alphahCRH. Last, administration of CRH1-receptor (CRH-R1) specific antagonist blocked colorectal distention-induced sensitization of the visceral perception in rats. Moreover, pretreatment with CRH-R1 antagonist blocked colorectal distention-induced anxiety, which was measured with elevated plus-maze, in rats. Evidence supporting the concept that peripheral CRH and CRH-R1 play important roles in brain-gut sensitization is increasing. Several studies have identified immunoreactive CRH and urocortin as well as CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 mRNAs in human colonic mucosa. In addition, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction has revealed the expression of CRH-R1 mRNA in both the myenteric and submucosal plexus in the guinea pig. Application of CRH has been shown to evoke depolarizing responses associated with elevated excitability in both myenteric and submucosal neurons. On the other hand, peripheral injection of CRH has been reported to induce discrete effects on colonic secretory and motor function, and permeability. There are functional differences between CRH-R1 and CRH-R2. For instance, activation of CRH-R1 causes a proinflammatory response, whereas stimulation of CRH-R2 provokes anti-inflammatory changes. In addition, there is evidence of the contrasting roles of CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 in visceral nociception. While CRH-R1 is involved in the pro-nociceptive effects of visceral pain, CRH-R2 mediates an anti-nociceptive response. These findings suggest the major role of CRH in stress-related pathophysiology of IBS and possibly in inflammation of the intestinal mucosa.",

        "Title": "Monitoring imaging of lesions induced by high intensity focused ultrasound based on differential ultrasonic attenuation and integrated backscatter estimation.",
        "Abstract": "We investigated the feasibility of two monitoring imaging methods to visualize and evaluate the high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) induced lesions in vitro during and after their formation, which were based on differential ultrasonic parameter estimation. Firstly, ultrasonic attenuation slope of tissue sample was estimated based on the spectral analysis of ultrasound RF backscattered signals. The differential attenuation slope maps were acquired, which were interpreted as the differences between the pretreatment image and those obtained in different stages during HIFU therapy. Secondly, ultrasonic integrated backscatter (IBS), defined as the frequency average of the backscatter transfer function over the useful bandwidth, was proposed quantitatively to evaluate the extent of lesions with the same RF signals as the first method. Differential IBS maps were also acquired to visualize temporal evolution of lesion formation. It was found in pig liver in vitro that more precise definition of the treated area was obtained from the differential IBS images than from differential attenuation slope images. Dramatic increase in both attenuation and IBS value was observed during the therapy, which may be related to dramatic enhancement of cavitation due to boiling and accompanying tissue damage. Two methods to obtain one differential image were compared and the cumulative differential image was found to be able to eliminate noises and artifacts to some extent, which was the cumulation of a series of differential images acquired from the differences between the temporally adjacent RF data frames. Moreover, we presented a bidirectional color code for identification of the artifacts due to tissue movements caused by HIFU radiation force. We conclude that cumulative differential IBS images have the potential to monitor the formation of HIFU-induced lesions.",

        "Abstract": "The presence of methane on lactulose breath test among irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subjects is highly associated with the constipation-predominant form. Therefore, we set out to determine whether methane gas can alter small intestinal motor function. In dogs, small intestinal fistulae were created to permit measurement of intestinal transit. Using a radiolabel, we evaluated transit during infusion of room air and subsequently methane. In this model, small intestinal infusion of methane produced a slowing of transit in all dogs by an average of 59%. In a second experiment, guinea pig ileum was pinned into an organ bath for the study of contractile activity in response to brush strokes applied to the mucosa. The force of contraction was measured both orad and aborad to the stimulus. The experiment was repeated while the bath was gassed with methane. Contractile activities orad and aborad to the stimulus were significantly augmented by methane compared with room air (P < 0.05). In a third experiment, humans with IBS who had undergone a small bowel motility study were compared such that subjects who produced methane on lactulose breath test were compared with those producing hydrogen. The motility index was significantly higher in methane-producing IBS patients (1,851 +/- 861) compared with hydrogen producers (1,199 +/- 301) (P < 0.05). Therefore, methane, a gaseous by-product of intestinal bacteria, slows small intestinal transit and appears to do so by augmenting small bowel contractile activity.",

        "Abstract": "Although initial results were promising for an injectable bone substitute (IBS) associating a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) polymer vector (Benecel, 2 w/w %) with biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP), a sensitization reaction occurred probably related to the degree of polymer purity. In this context, Benecel and another HPMC, E4M were investigated in the present study. The expected composition of the polymers was confirmed by gas-liquid chromatography. Studies in the guinea pig showed that Benecel has strong sensitization capacity and E4M none. Benecel manifests impurities (30 times more than E4M) in individual fibers or rounded clumps that are apparently responsible for extreme sensitization. Purification by ultracentrifugation associated with 0.2 microm filtration can decrease sensitization capacity considerably, though with a slight loss of polymer concentration. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis showed that the impurities were largely cellulose derivatives. However, extraction by organic solvent, followed by FTIR studies and micro-X analysis, detected an oily substance containing carbon and silicon associated with the cellulose derivatives. E4M, a polymer with no sensitization capacity, could replace Benecel and improve results with IBS.",

We investigated whether alosetron, a novel 5HT3 antagonist proposed for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), blocks I(Kr) in guinea pig cardiac myocytes. I(Kr) was isolated under whole-cell voltage clamp, and was identified by its sensitivity to the selective I(Kr) antagonist E4031. Cisapride (10(-6) M) inhibited the E4031-sensitive current while alosetron (10(-10)-10(-6) M) had no effect on I(Kr). We also found that alosetron did not inhibit I(Ks).

Forty single-rooted teeth were mechanically instrumented and irrigated with QMix, SmearOFF, Irritrol or 0.9% saline. Each tooth was evaluated for smear layer removal using scanning electron microscopy. Precipitation after interaction of the irrigating solutions with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) was evaluated with <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the irrigants against Enterococcus faecalis biofilms. Neutral red and clonogenic assays were performed on Chinese hamster V79 cells to evaluate the short-term and long-term cytotoxicity of the irrigants. There was no significant difference between QMix and SmearOFF in eliminating smear layers from the coronal-third and middle-third of the canal spaces. In the apical-third, SmearOFF removed smear layers effectively. Irritrol incompletely removed smear layers from all the canal-thirds. When mixed with NaOCl, precipitation was evident only with Irritrol. QMix demonstrated a higher E. faecalis cell death percentage and a smaller biovolume. SmearOFF exhibited a larger decrease in biovolume compared with Irritrol, although Irritrol had a higher death percentage. Irritrol was more cytotoxic than the other irrigants on a short-term interval. In terms of long-term cytotoxicity, both Irritrol and QMix were cytotoxic. QMix and SmearOFF performed better in smear layer removal and antimicrobial activity. QMix and Irritrol were cytotoxic when compared to SmearOFF. Irritrol was associated with precipitation after interacting with NaOCl. Evaluation of the smear layer removal capability, antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of 2-in-1 root canal irrigants is necessary to ensure that they are safe to use during root canal treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Perinatal nutrition is thought to affect the long-term risk of the adult to develop metabolic syndrome. We hypothesized that maternal supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid during pregnancy and lactation would protect offspring fed a high-fat diet from developing metabolic disturbances. Thus, two groups of female hamsters were fed a low-fat control diet, either alone (LC) or enriched with n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) (LO), through the gestational and lactation periods. After weaning, male pups were randomized to separate groups that received either a control low-fat diet (LC) or a high-fat diet (HC) for 16 weeks. Four groups of pups were defined (LC-LC, LC-HC, LO-LC and LO-HC), based on the combinations of maternal and weaned diets. Maternal n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation was associated with reduced levels of basal plasma glucose, hepatic triglycerides secretion and postprandial lipemia in the LO-HC group compared to the LC-HC group. Respiratory parameters were not affected by maternal supplementation. In contrast, n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation significantly enhanced the activities of citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase compared to the offspring of unsupplemented mothers. Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 expression levels were not affected by n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation. These results provide evidence for a beneficial effect of n-3 LC-PUFA maternal supplementation in hamsters on the subsequent risk of metabolic syndrome. Underlying mechanisms may include improved lipid metabolism and activation of the mitochondrial oxidative pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Intercellular bridges (IBs) connecting mammalian germ cells get transiently closed during cell divisions by a structure termed the bridge-partitioning complex (BPC). It is composed of a compact stack of transverse endomembrane cisterns that are laterally anchored to the thickened bridge wall (bridge density). Studying male gonads of the golden hamster, the formation of the BPC during prophase/prometaphase transition and its dissolution in late telophase of germ cell divisions was followed. 1) There are strong indications for the involvement of a microtubule-based transport mechanism in the movement of membrane-bound vesicles toward and away from the site of the BPC during its formation or dissolution, respectively. 2) The BPC is built up exactly within the central segment of the IB carrying the bridge density. This feature suggests a specific interaction between components of the (forming) BPC and the material constituting the bridge density. The bridge density might be involved in locally directing the process of BPC formation within germ cell IBs.",

        "Abstract": "1. Otilonium bromide (OB) is a smooth muscle relaxant used in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Otilonium bromide has been shown to interfere with the mobilization of calcium in intestinal smooth muscle, but the effects on other intestinal tissues have not been investigated. We identified the muscarinic receptor subtype coupled to calcium signals in colonic crypt derived from the human colonic epithelium and evaluated the inhibitory effects of OB. 2. Calcium signals were monitored by fluorescence imaging of isolated human colonic crypts and Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the cloned human muscarinic M(3) receptor subtype (CHO-M(3)). Colonic crypt receptor expression was investigated by pharmacological and immunohistochemical techniques. 3. The secretagogue acetylcholine (ACh) stimulated calcium mobilization from intracellular calcium stores at the base of human colonic crypts with an EC(50) of 14 micro M. The muscarinic receptor antagonists 4-DAMP, AF-DX 384, pirenzepine and methroctamine inhibited the ACh-induced calcium signal with the following respective IC(50) (pK(b)) values: 0.78 nM (9.1), 69 nM (7.2), 128 nM (7.1), and 2510 nM (5.8). 4. Immunohistochemical analyses of muscarinic receptor expression demonstrated the presence of M(3) receptor subtype expression at the crypt-base. 5. Otilonium bromide inhibited the generation of ACh-induced calcium signals in a dose dependent manner (IC(50)=880 nM). 6. In CHO-M(3) cells, OB inhibited calcium signals induced by ACh, but not ATP. In addition, OB did not inhibit histamine-induced colonic crypt calcium signals. 7. The present studies have demonstrated that OB inhibited M(3) receptor-coupled calcium signals in human colonic crypts and CHO-M(3) cells, but not those induced by stimulation of other endogenous receptor types. We propose that the M(3) receptor-coupled calcium signalling pathway is directly targeted by OB at the level of the colonic epithelium, suggestive of an anti-secretory action in IBS patients suffering with diarrhoea.",

        "Abstract": "Intercellular bridges (IBs) connecting the cytoplasms of a defined type of defective germ cell division (\"arrested mitoses\") in male and female gonads of the immature golden hamster were studied by electron microscopy. In both sexes, such cells appear at the time when germ cells switch from mitotic proliferation to the onset of meiotic prophase, i.e., during a short perinatal period in the female and during pubertal maturation in the male golden hamster. These cells are arrested and finally degenerate. IBs of these cells completely lack the bridge-partitioning complex (BPC), a structure composed of a stack of transverse endomembrane cisternae which normally fills the IBs during subsequent divisions of bridge-connected germ cells. This unique exception from the usual course of clonal proliferation of mammalian germ cells has several implications: (1) The supposed barrier function of the BPC is missing in the defective germ cell divisions; (2) the failure to form the BPC might be related to a disturbed microtubule apparatus in the cells; (3) the absence of the BPC possibly reflects the influence of conflicting environmental signals, inducing both mitotic and early meiotic mechanisms in the cells at this crucial point of gametogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "The term \"inflammatory bowel disease,\" which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), refers to a chronic inflammatory condition of the digestive system. There are many different treatment options, such as corticosteroids, biologics, 5-aminosalicylate, and immune-suppressants, but none of them can maintain the disease remission for a longer period, which is the ultimate goal of treatment. Furthermore, they have numerous serious side effects like nephrotoxicity, infertility, congestive heart failure, myopathy, etc. So, in order to treat these conditions, researchers are concentrating more on natural medicine that is less expensive and has fewer side effects. The current analysis includes a list of plants showing promising activity against IBD. These include Cannabis sativa, Aloe vera, Boswellia serrata, Withania somnifera, Curcuma longa, Triticum aestivum, and many others. These plants need to be further investigated in terms of preclinical and clinical studies to obtain the safety and efficacy data necessary for their commercialisation. Global regulatory norms will facilitate simple commercialisation. Also, more investigation is required to pinpoint the precise mechanism of action to confirm clinical success.",

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of herbal interventions for IBD, addressing scientific, regulatory, clinical, and patient-related considerations. Scientifically, the exploration of herbal interventions faces challenges related to the complexity of herbal formulations, standardization, and quality control. Regulatory hurdles encompass stringent requirements for safety, efficacy, and quality standards, necessitating adherence to robust preclinical and clinical protocols.

        "Abstract": "Cumulative preclinical evidence reported quercetin, a major flavonoid, can attenuate the disease activity of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, there is limited evidence that supports the benefits of quercetin for patients with IBD. To investigate whether dietary quercetin intake is associated with adverse outcomes among individuals with IBD in a prospective cohort study. We included 2293 participants with IBD (764 Crohn's disease [CD] and 1529 ulcerative colitis [UC]) from the UK Biobank. Dietary information was collected using validated 24-h dietary assessments, and quercetin intake was estimated based on national nutrient databases. Two outcomes, enterotomy and all-cause mortality, were obtained based on the national data. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). After a mean (standard deviation) follow-up of 9.6 (1.8) y, we documented 193 enterotomy events and 176 deaths. Compared with participants with the lowest quartile intake of quercetin, those in the highest quartiles were associated with lower risk of enterotomy (HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.76) and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.83) in IBD. The inverse associations between quercetin and enterotomy were consistent in CD (HR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.78) but not UC (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.32, 1.07), while the inverse associations between quercetin and mortality were consistent both in CD (HR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.92) and UC (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.95). Higher dietary intake of quercetin was associated with lower risk of enterotomy and all-cause mortality in IBD. Our study provides novel evidence that further suggests the benefits of quercetin for patients with IBD, while also calling for further validation in other cohorts and clinical trials.",

Six patients with preclinical IBD (3 ulcerative colitis, 67% left-sided; 3 Crohn's disease, 100% ileal, 67% inflammatory behavior) and 13 healthy non-IBD controls were included. No relevant occupational exposures were identified. We found statistically significant higher levels of sodium, potassium, and boron among cases compared to controls; while lower levels of zinc, uranium, copper, and germanium were observed. A range of environmental exposures can be identified during the preclinical phase of IBD, but their relationship with the symptomatic onset and disease progression should be further explored.",

        "Abstract": "Cytokines produced by immune cells contribute to the development and perpetuation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), namely Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, by regulating various aspects of the inflammatory response. Pro-inflammatory cytokines trigger chronic intestinal inflammation, tissue damage, carcinogenesis and perpetuation of disease and suppress the resolution of inflammation in IBD. The clinical success of antibodies that neutralize tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and the\u00a0cytokine\u00a0IL-12p40 in individuals with IBD has underscored this concept. Moreover, genetic and preclinical studies have emphasized the crucial role of IL-23 in IBD, leading to clinical approval of antibodies targeting this cytokine. Multiple studies have also investigated the administration of cytokines with assumed anti-inflammatory effects, but this approach has yet to show any real clinical benefit in individuals with IBD. Recent studies have targeted the cytokine network through the use of multi-cytokine blockers (for example, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors), IL-2-induced regulatory T cells or advanced combination therapies that use multiple cytokine blockers simultaneously (for example, anti-TNF along with anti-IL-23 antibodies). This Review will focus on our current understanding of how cytokines produced by innate and adaptive immune cells contribute to IBD pathogenesis and discuss how their modulation may inform future treatments for IBD.",

        "Abstract": "At present, preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are insufficient, limiting translation between research and new therapeutics. This is especially true for fistulising Crohn's disease (CD), as the severe lack of relevant models hinders research progression. To address this, we present <i>in vitro</i> human IBD mucosal models that recapitulate multiple pathological hallmarks of IBD simultaneously in one model system - immune cell infiltration, stromal remodelling and epithelial disruption. Stimulation of models induces epithelial aberrations common in IBD tissue including altered morphology, microvilli abnormalities, claudin gene expression changes and increased permeability. Inflammatory biomarkers are also significantly increased including cytokines and chemokines integral to IBD pathogenesis. Evidence of extracellular matrix remodelling, including upregulated matrix-metalloproteinases and altered basement membrane components, suggests the models simulate pathological stromal remodelling events that closely resemble fistulising CD. Importantly, MMP-9 is the most abundant MMP and mimics the unique localisation observed in IBD tissue. The inflamed models were subsequently used to elucidate the involvement of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN- \u03b3 in intestinal stromal remodelling, in which TNF-\u03b1 but not IFN- \u03b3 induced MMP upregulation, specifically of MMP-3 and MMP-9.

        "Abstract": "The therapeutic management of Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is highly challenging. Surgical resection is sometimes a necessary procedure even though it is often associated with postoperative recurrences (PORs). Tofacitinib, an orally active small molecule Janus kinase inhibitor, is an anti-inflammatory drug meant to limit PORs in CD. Whereas bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiota and the relevant IBD drug are crucial, little is known about the impact of tofacitinib on the gut microbiota. The HLA-B27 transgenic rat is a good preclinical model used in IBD research, including for PORs after ileocecal resection (ICR). In the present study, we used shotgun metagenomics to first delineate the baseline composition and determinants of the fecal microbiome of HLA-B27 rats and then to evaluate the distinct impact of either tofacitinib treatment, ileocecal resection or the cumulative effect of both interventions on the gut microbiota in these HLA-B27 rats. The results confirmed that the microbiome of the HLA-B27 rats was fairly different from their wild-type littermates. We demonstrated here that oral treatment with tofacitinib does not affect the gut microbial composition of HLA-B27 rats. Of note, we showed that ICR induced an intense loss of bacterial diversity together with dramatic changes in taxa relative abundances. However, the oral treatment with tofacitinib neither modified the alpha-diversity nor exacerbated significant modifications in bacterial taxa induced by ICR. Collectively, these preclinical data are rather favorable for the use of tofacitinib in combination with ICR to address Crohn's disease management when considering microbiota.",

        "Abstract": "Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an established dietary treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) by alleviating inflammation and inducing remission. However, the mechanisms of action of EEN are incompletely understood. As CD is associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis, we investigated the effect of EEN on the microbiome in a rat model of CD-like colitis. The rat model of CD-like colitis was established by an intracolonic instillation of TNBS at 65 mg/kg in 250 \u00b5L of 40% ethanol. Sham control rats were instilled with saline. Rats were fed ad libitum with either regular pellet food or EEN treatment with a clear liquid diet (Ensure). Rats were euthanized at 7 days. Fecal pellets were collected from the distal colon for 16S rRNA sequencing analysis of gut microbiota. In addition, colon tissues were taken for histological and molecular analyses in all the groups of rats. EEN administration to TNBS-induced CD rats significantly improved the body weight change, inflammation scores, and disease activity index. The mRNA expression of IL-17A and interferon-\u03b3 was significantly increased in the colonic tissue in TNBS rats when fed with regular food. However, EEN treatment significantly attenuated the increase in IL-17A and interferon-\u03b3 in TNBS rats. Our 16S rRNA sequencing analysis found that gut microbiota diversity and compositions were significantly altered in TNBS rats, compared to controls. However, EEN treatment improved alpha diversity and increased certain beneficial bacteria such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Dubosiella</i> and decreased bacteria such as <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Enterorhabdus</i> in CD-like rats, compared to CD-like rats with the regular pellet diet. In conclusion, EEN treatment increases the diversity of gut microbiota and the composition of certain beneficial bacteria. These effects may contribute to the reduced inflammation by EEN in the rat model of CD-like colitis.",

Consistently, in CD patients treated with etrolizumab, T cell activation correlates with cytotoxic signatures. Collectively, our findings might add one important piece to the puzzle to explain phase III trial results with etrolizumab, while they also highlight that \u03b1E\u03b27 remains an interesting target for future therapeutic approaches in inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "Abstract": "Intestinal fibrosis resulting in stricture formation and obstruction in Crohn's disease (CD) and increased wall stiffness leading to symptoms in ulcerative colitis (UC) is among the largest unmet needs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fibrosis is caused by a multifactorial and complex process involving immune and non-immune cells, their soluble mediators and exposure to luminal contents, such as microbiota and environmental factors. To date, no antifibrotic therapy is available. Some progress has been made in creating consensus definitions and measurements to quantify stricture morphology for clinical practice and trials, but approaches to determine the degree of fibrosis within a stricture are still lacking. We herein describe the current state of stricture pathogenesis, measuring tools and clinical trial endpoints development. Data presented and discussed in this review derive from the past and recent literature and the authors' own research and experience. Significant progress has been made in better understanding the pathogenesis of fibrosis, but additional studies and preclinical developments are needed to define specific therapeutic targets.",

        "Abstract": "This review aims to identify in\u00a0vivo studies investigating the potential of plant substances and their natural molecules in managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Specifically, the objective is to examine the impact of these substances on interleukins and other key inflammatory signaling markers. Relevant articles published up to December 2022 were identified through a search of the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases. The search used keywords including \"inflammatory bowel disease\", \"medicinal plants\", \"natural molecules\", \"anti-inflammatory\", and \"ulcerative colitis\", and identified 1,878 potentially relevant articles, of which 89 were included in this review after completion of the selection process. This study provides preclinical data on natural products (NPs) that can potentially treat IBD, including ulcerative colitis. The main actions of these NPs relate to their effects on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway, the regulation of T helper 17/regulatory T cells balance, and oxidative stress. The ability of these NPs to inhibit intestinal inflammation appears to be dependent on lowering levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-17, via the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1, NF-\u03ba\u03b2-p65, and STAT3 pathways. In addition, NPs were shown to reduce oxidative stress and the severity of ulcerative colitis, as well as increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes. These actions suggest that NPs represent a promising treatment for IBD, and potentially have greater efficacy and safety than current treatments.",

However, in moderate-to-severe cases, the therapeutic response is still far from optimal, and treatment changes and optimizations are often required. Thus, researchers in this field are strongly engaged in studies aiming to identify new potential therapeutic targets. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are tiny subcellular bodies with a phospholipid bilayer envelope containing bioactive molecules, which are released from different cells and are involved in intercellular communication. Recent pre-clinical data show their emerging role in the pathogenesis and treatment of IBD. In our review, we summarize current evidence about the function of EVs as active therapeutic agents in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, analyzing the properties of EVs derived from different cellular sources and the mechanisms through which they may improve intestinal inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an umbrella term for two conditions (Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis) that is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The use of pre-clinical animal models has been invaluable for the understanding of potential disease mechanisms. However, despite promising results of numerous therapeutics in mouse colitis models, many of these therapies did not show clinical benefits in patients with IBD. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has recently revolutionized our understanding of complex interactions between the immune system, stromal cells, and epithelial cells by mapping novel cell subpopulations and their remodeling during disease. This technology has not been widely applied to pre-clinical models of IBD. ScRNA-seq profiling of murine models may provide an opportunity to increase the translatability into the clinic, and to choose the most appropriate model to test hypotheses and novel therapeutics. In this review, we have summarized some of the key findings at the single cell transcriptomic level in IBD, how specific signatures have been functionally validated <i>in vivo</i>, and highlighted the similarities and differences between scRNA-seq findings in human IBD and experimental mouse models. In each section of this review, we highlight the importance of utilizing this technology to find the most suitable or translational models of IBD based on the cellular therapeutic target.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which are characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. IBDs clinical manifestations are heterogeneous and characterized by a chronic relapsing-remitting course. Typical gastrointestinal signs and symptoms include diarrhea, GI bleeding, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Moreover, the presence of pain often manifests in the remitting disease phase. As a result, patients report a further reduction in life quality. Despite the scientific advances implemented in the last two decades and the therapies aimed at inducing or maintaining IBDs in a remissive condition, to date, their pathophysiology still remains unknown. In this scenario, the importance of identifying a common and effective therapeutic target for both digestive symptoms and pain remains a priority. Recent clinical and preclinical studies have reported the prokineticin system (PKS) as an emerging therapeutic target for IBDs. PKS alterations are likely to play a role in IBDs at multiple levels, such as in intestinal motility, local inflammation, ulceration processes, localized abdominal and visceral pain, as well as central nervous system sensitization, leading to the development of chronic and widespread pain. This narrative review summarized the evidence about the involvement of the PKS in IBD and discussed its potential as a druggable target.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID) of the gastrointestinal tract and includes two subtypes: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. It is well-recognized that IBD is associated with a complex multifactorial aetiology that includes genetic predisposition and environmental exposures, with downstream dysregulation of systemic immune function and host-microbial interactions in the local environment in the gut. Evidence to support the notion of a multistage development of IBD is growing, as has been observed in other IMIDs such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. With the rising worldwide incidence of IBD, it is increasingly important to understand the complex interplay of pathological events during the different stages of disease development to enable IBD prediction and prevention strategies. In this article, we review comprehensively the current evidence pertaining to the preclinical phase of IBD, including at-risk, initiation and expansion phases. We also discuss the framework of preclinical IBD, expanding on underlying pathways in IBD development, future research directions and IBD development in the context of other IMIDs.",

We observe widespread significant changes in multiple biochemical and hematological parameters that occur up to 8 years before diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) and up to 3 years before diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. These changes far exceed previous expectations regarding the length of this pre-diagnostic\u00a0phase, revealing an opportunity for earlier intervention, especially in CD.

        "Abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is an intracellular sensor and an essential component of the innate immune system involved in danger recognition. An important hallmark of inflammasome activation is the formation of a single supramolecular punctum, known as a speck, per cell, which is the site where the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 are converted into their bioactive form. Speck also provides the platform for gasdermin D protein activation, whose N-terminus domain perforates the plasma membrane, allowing the release of mature cytokines alongside with a highly inflammatory form of cell death, namely pyroptosis. Although controlled NLRP3 inflammasome-pyroptosis pathway activation preserves mucosal immunity homeostasis and contributes to host defense, a prolonged trigger is deleterious and could lead, in genetically predisposed subjects, to the onset of inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, as well as to gastrointestinal cancer. Experimental evidence shows that the NLRP3 inflammasome has both protective and pathogenic abilities. In this review we highlight the impact of the NLRP3-pyroptosis axis on the pathophysiology of the gastrointestinal tract at molecular level, focusing on newly discovered features bearing pro- and anti-inflammatory and neoplastic activity, and on targeted therapies tested in preclinical and clinical trials.",

        "Title": "Application of Drug Repurposing Approach for Therapeutic Intervention of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.",
        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), represented by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) characterized by chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation, abdominal pain, cramping, loss of appetite, fatigue, diarrhoea, and weight loss. Although the etiology of IBD remains unclear, it is believed to be an interaction between genes, and environmental factors, such as an imbalance of the intestinal microbiota, changing food habits, an ultra-hygiene environment, and an inappropriate immune system. The development of novel effective therapies is stymied by a lack of understanding of the aetiology of IBD. The current therapy involves the use of aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, and corticosteroids that can effectively manage symptoms, induce and sustain remission, prevent complications, modify the course of the disease, provide diverse treatment options, showcase advancements in biologic therapies, and enhance the overall quality of life. However, the efficacy of current therapy is overshadowed by a plethora of adverse effects, such as loss of weight, mood swings, skin issues, loss of bone density, higher vulnerability to infections, and elevated blood pressure. Biologicals, like anti-tumour necrosis factor agents, can stimulate an autoimmune response in certain individuals that may diminish the effectiveness of the medication over time, necessitating a switch to alternative treatments. The response of IBD patients to current drug therapy is quite varied, which can lead to disease flares that underlines the urgent need to explore alternative treatment option to address the unmet need of developing new treatment strategies for IBD with high efficacy and fewer adverse effects. Drug repurposing is a novel strategy where existing drugs that have already been validated safe in patients for the management of certain diseases are redeployed to treat other, unindicated diseases. The present narrative review focuses on potential drug candidates that could be repurposed for the management of IBD using on-target and off-target strategies. It covers their preclinical, clinical assessment, mechanism of action, and safety profiles, and forecasts their appropriateness in the management of IBD. The review presents useful insights into the most promising candidates for repurposing, like anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic troxerutin, which has been found to improve the DSS-induced colitis in rats, an antiosteoarthritic drug diacetylrhein that has been found to have remarkable ameliorating effects on DSS-induced colitis via anti-oxidant and anti- inflammatory properties and by influencing both apoptosis and pyroptosis. Topiramate, an antiepileptic and anticonvulsant drug, has remarkably decreased overall pathophysiological and histopathological events in the experimental model of IBD in rodents by its cytokine inhibitory action.",

A number of reports suggests a protective effect, whereas others show a pathogenic impact. The present review article aimed to explore and discuss the findings of experimental and clinical investigations evaluating the effects of MAIT cells in IBD subjects and animal models. Findings indicate that MAIT cells could exert opposite effects in the course of IBD, including an anti-inflammatory protective effect of blood circulating MAIT cells and an effector pathogenic effect of colonic MAIT cells. Another important finding is that blood levels of MAIT cells can be considered as a potential biomarker in IBD patients.",

In this review, we present a literature overview of the interactions between diet and E. coli and other Proteobacteria in the aetiology, outcomes and management of IBD and suggest future research directions. An extensive literature search was performed to identify in vitro studies and research in animal models that explored mechanisms by which dietary components can interact with E. coli or Proteobacteria to initiate or propagate gut inflammation. We also explored the effect diet and dietary therapies have on the levels of E. coli or Proteobacteria in patients with IBD. Preclinical data suggest that the Western diet and its components influence the abundance, colonisation and phenotypic behaviour of E. coli in the gut, which may in turn initiate or contribute to gut inflammation. In contrast, the Mediterranean diet and specific dietary fibres may abrogate these effects and protect from inflammation. There are limited data from clinical trials, mostly from patients with Crohn's disease during treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition, with findings often challenging observations from preclinical research. Data from patients with ulcerative colitis are sparse. Preclinical and some clinical trial data suggest that E. coli and other Proteobacteria interact with certain dietary components to promote gut inflammation. Well-designed clinical trials are required before dietary recommendations for disease management can be made.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is one of the 2 main phenotypes of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs); CD ischaracterized by a discontinuous, spontaneously recurring, transmural immunopathology that largely affects the terminal ileum. Crohn's disease exhibits both a relapsing and progressive course, and its prevalence is on the rise globally, mirroring the trends of industrialization. While the precise pathogenesis of CD remains unknown, various factors including immune cell dysregulation, microbial dysbiosis, genetic susceptibility, and environmental factors have been implicated in disease etiology. Animal models, particularly ileitis mouse models, have provided valuable tools for studying the specific mechanisms underlying CD, allowing longitudinal assessment and sampling in interventional preclinical studies. Furthermore, animal models assess to evaluate the distinct role that bacterial and dietary antigens play in causing inflammation, using germ-free animals, involving the introduction of individual bacteria (monoassociation studies), and experimenting with well-defined dietary components. An ideal animal model for studying IBD, specifically CD, should exhibit an inherent intestinal condition that arises spontaneously and closely mimics the distinct transmural inflammation observed in the human disease, particularly in the terminal ileum. We have recently characterized the impact of disease-relevant, noninfectious microbiota and specific bacteria in a mouse model that replicates CD-like ileitis, capturing the intricate nature of human CD, namely the TNF\u2206ARE mouse model. Using germ-free mice, we studied the impact of different diets on the expansion of disease-relevant pathobionts and on the severity of inflammation.

        "Title": "Generation and Characterization of Mirikizumab, a Humanized Monoclonal Antibody Targeting the p19 Subunit of IL-23.",
        "Abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-23 exists as a heterodimer consisting of p19 and p40 and is a key cytokine for promoting inflammatory responses in a variety of target organs. IL-23 plays a key role in the differentiation and maintenance of T helper 17 cells, and deregulation of IL-23 can result in autoimmune pathologies of the skin, lungs, and gut. This study describes the generation and characterization of mirikizumab (miri), a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody directed against the p19 subunit of IL-23. Miri binds human and cynomolgus monkey IL-23 with high affinity and binds rabbit IL-23 weakly but does not bind to rodent IL-23 or the other IL-23 family members IL-12, IL-27, or IL-35. Miri effectively inhibits the interaction of IL-23 with its receptor, and potently blocks IL-23-induced IL-17 production in cell-based assays while preserving the function of IL-12. In both local and systemic in vivo mouse models, miri blocked IL-23-induced keratin mRNA or IL-17 production, respectively. These data provide a comprehensive preclinical characterization of miri, for which efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in human clinical trials for psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This article describes the generation and characterization of mirikizumab, a high affinity, neutralizing IgG4 variant monoclonal antibody that is under development for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Neutralization of interleukin (IL)-23 is achieved by preventing the binding of IL-23 p19 subunit to the IL-23 receptor and does not affect the IL-12 pathway.",

The NOD/SCID/IL2r\u03b3<sup>null</sup> (NSG) mouse strain, which is immune-compromised, tolerates the engraftment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from patients with UC (NSG-UC) or CD (NSG-CD). This offers the opportunity to examine the impact of individual immunological background on the development of pathophysiological manifestations. When challenged with ethanol, NSG-UC mice exhibited a strong pro-inflammatory response, including the development of edemas, influx of human T cells, B cells and monocytes into the mucosa and submucosa, and elevated expression of the inflammatory markers CRP and CCL-7. Fibrotic alterations were characterized by an influx of fibroblasts and a thickening of the muscularis mucosae. In contrast, the development of pathological manifestations in NSG-CD mice developed without challenge and was signified by extensive collagen deposition between the muscularis propria and muscularis mucosae, as observed in the areas of strictures in CD patients. Vimentin-expressing fibroblasts supplanting colonic crypts and elevated expression of HGF and TGF\u00df corroborated the remodeling phenotype. In summary, the NSG-UC and NSG-CD models partially reflect these human diseases and are powerful tools to examine the mechanism underlying the inflammatory processes in UC and CD.",

        "Abstract": "The field of regenerative medicine, including cellular immunotherapies, is on a remarkable growth trajectory. Dozens of cell-, tissue- and gene-based products have received marketing authorization worldwide while hundreds-to-thousands are either in preclinical development or under clinical investigation in phased clinical trials. However, the promise of regenerative therapies has also given rise to a global industry of direct-to-consumer offerings of prematurely commercialized cell and cell-based products with unknown safety and efficacy profiles. Since its inception, the International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy Committee on the Ethics of Cell and Gene Therapy has opposed the premature commercialization of unproven cell- and gene-based interventions and supported the development of evidence-based advanced therapy products. In the present Guide, targeted at International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy members, we analyze this industry, focusing in particular on distinctive features of unproven cell and cell-based products and the use of tokens of scientific legitimacy as persuasive marketing devices. We also provide an overview of reporting mechanisms for patients who believe they have been harmed by administration of unapproved and unproven products and suggest practical strategies to address the direct-to-consumer marketing of such products. Development of this Guide epitomizes our continued support for the ethical and rigorous development of cell and cell-based products with patient safety and therapeutic benefit as guiding principles.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic, inflammatory, and autoimmune disease, but its specific etiology and pathogenesis are still unclear. This study aimed to better discover the causative basement membrane (BM) genes of their subtypes and their associations. The differential expression of BM genes between CD and UC was analyzed and validated by downloading relevant datasets from the GEO database. We divided the samples into 3 groups for comparative analysis. Construction of PPI networks, enrichment of differential gene functions, screening of Lasso regression models, validation of ROC curves, nomogram for disease prediction and other analytical methods were used. The immune cell infiltration was further explored by ssGSEA analysis, the immune correlates of hub BM genes were found, and finally, the hub central genes were screened by machine learning. We obtained 6 candidate hub BM genes related to cellular immune infiltration in the CD and UC groups, respectively, and further screened the central hub genes ADAMTS17 and ADAMTS9 through machine learning. And in the ROC curve models, AUC\u2009>\u20090.7, indicating that this characteristic gene has a more accurate predictive effect on IBD. We also found that the pathogenicity-related BM genes of the CD and UC groups were mainly concentrated in the ADAMTS family (ADAMTS17 and ADAMTS9). Addition there are some differences between the two subtypes, and the central different hub BM genes are SPARC, POSTN, and ADAMTS2. In the current study, we provided a nomogram model of CD and UC composed of BM genes, identified central hub genes, and clarified the similarities and differences between CD and UC. This will have potential value for preclinical, clinical, and translational guidance and differential research in IBD.",

The GVB facilitates nutrient absorption and blocks bacterial translocation through its size-restricted permeability. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysfunction of this barrier correlates with several clinical pathologies including Crohn's disease (CD). Significant progress has been made to elucidate the mechanism of GVB dysfunction and to confirm the participation of disrupted GVB in the course of CD. However, further analyses are required to pinpoint the specific roles of GVB in CD pathogenesis. Many preclinical models and clinical trials have demonstrated that various agents are effective in protecting the GVB integrity and thus providing a potential CD treatment strategy. Through this review, we established a systemic understanding of the role of GVB in CD pathogenesis and provided novel insights for GVB-targeting strategies in CD treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease-(CD) pathogenesis is still unknown and chronic pain is a frequent symptom in CD-patients. Identifying novel therapeutic targets and predisposing factors is a primary goal. In this regard, prokineticin system-(PKS) appears a promising target. TNBS-model was used. DAI, abdominal and visceral pain, and muscle strength were monitored. CD-mice were sacrificed at two times (day 7 and 14 after TNBS) in order to identify PKS involvement in CD pathophysiology and pain. PKS characterization was performed in mesenteric lymph nodes-(MLN), colon, myenteric plexus-(MP), dorsal root ganglia-(DRGs) and spinal cord-(SC). Inflammation/neuroinflammation was also assessed in the same tissues. In order to evaluate alcohol abuse as a possible trigger for CD and its effect on PKS activation, na\u00efve mice were administered (oral-gavage) with ethanol for 10 consecutive days. PKS as well as inflammation/neuroinflammation were evaluated in MLN, colon and MP. TNBS treated-mice showed a rapid increase in DAI, abdominal/visceral hypersensitivity and a progressive strength loss. In all tissue analysed of CD-mice, a quick and significant increase of mRNA of PKs and PKRs was observed, associated with an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1) and macrophage/glia markers (iba1, CD11b and GFAP) levels. In alcohol abuse model, ethanol induced in colon and MP a significant PKS activation accompanied by inflammation/neuroinflammation. We can assume that PKS may be involved in CD development and pain. Furthermore, alcohol appears to activate PKS and may be a trigger factor for CD.",

        "Abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) may be a weight management strategy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this short narrative review is to summarize the evidence related to IF in the management of IBD. A literature search of English publications related to IF or time-restricted feeding and IBD, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar. Four publications on studies of IF in IBD were found: three randomized controlled trials in animal models of colitis and one prospective observational study in patients with IBD. The results from animal studies suggest either moderate or no changes in weight but improvements in colitis with IF. These improvements may be mediated through changes in the gut microbiome, decreased oxidative stress and increased colonic short-chain fatty acids. The study in humans was small and uncontrolled, and it did not assess changes in weight, making it difficult to draw conclusions around the effects of IF on changes in weight or disease course. Given that preclinical evidence suggests intermittent fasting may play a beneficial role in IBD, randomized controlled trials in large patients with active disease are warranted to determine whether intermittent fasting could be an integrated therapy for patients with IBD management, either for weight or for disease management. These studies should also explore the potential mechanisms of action related to intermittent fasting.",

        "Abstract": "Myeloid cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs), including Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). Dysregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway is associated with many pathological conditions, including IBD. Suppressors Of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) are a family of proteins that negatively regulate the JAK/STAT pathway. Our previous studies identified that mice lacking <i>Socs3</i> in myeloid cells developed a hyper-activated phenotype of macrophages and neutrophils in a pre-clinical model of Multiple Sclerosis. To better understand the function of myeloid cell <i>Socs3</i> in the pathogenesis of colitis, mice with <i>Socs3</i> deletion in myeloid cells (<i>Socs3</i> <sup>\u0394LysM</sup>) were utilized in a DSS-induced colitis model. Our results indicate that <i>Socs3</i> deficiency in myeloid cells leads to more severe colitis induced by DSS, which correlates with increased infiltration of monocytes and neutrophils in the colon and increased numbers of monocytes and neutrophils in the spleen. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the expression of genes related to the pathogenesis and diagnosis of colitis such as <i>Il1\u03b2</i>, <i>Lcn2</i>, <i>S100a8</i> and <i>S100a9</i> were specifically enhanced in <i>Socs3</i>-deficient neutrophils localized to the colon and spleen. Conversely, there were no observable differences in gene expression in Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes. Depletion of neutrophils using a neutralizing antibody to Ly6G significantly improved the disease severity of DSS-induced colitis in <i>Socs3</i>-deficient mice. Thus, our results suggest that deficiency of <i>Socs3</i> in myeloid cells exacerbates DSS-induced colitis and that <i>Socs3</i> prevents overt activation of the immune system in IBD. This study may provide novel therapeutic strategies to IBD patients with hyperactivated neutrophils.",

        "Abstract": "The cause of Crohn's disease (CD) is unknown, but the current hypothesis is that microbial or environmental factors induce gut inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals, leading to chronic intestinal inflammation. Case-control studies of patients with CD have cataloged alterations in the gut microbiome composition; however, these studies fail to distinguish whether the altered gut microbiome composition is associated with initiation of CD or is the result of inflammation or drug treatment. In this prospective cohort study, 3483 healthy first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with CD were recruited to identify the gut microbiome composition that precedes the onset of CD and to what extent this composition predicts the risk of developing CD. We applied a machine learning approach to the analysis of the gut microbiome composition (based on 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing) to define a microbial signature that associates with future development of CD. The performance of the model was assessed in an independent validation cohort. In the validation cohort, the microbiome risk score (MRS) model yielded a hazard ratio of 2.24 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-4.84; P\u00a0= .04), using the median of the MRS from the discovery cohort as the threshold. The MRS demonstrated a temporal validity by capturing individuals that developed CD up to 5 years before disease onset (area under the curve > 0.65). The 5 most important taxa contributing to the MRS included Ruminococcus torques, Blautia, Colidextribacter, an uncultured genus-level group from Oscillospiraceae, and Roseburia. This study is the first to demonstrate that gut microbiome composition is associated with future onset of CD and suggests that gut microbiome is a contributor in the pathogenesis of CD.",

        "Abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and celiac disease are prevalent intestinal inflammatory disorders with nonsatisfactory therapeutic interventions. Analyzing patient data-driven cohorts can highlight disease pathways and new targets for interventions. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are attractive candidates, since they are readily targetable by RNA therapeutics, show relative cell-specific expression, and play key cellular functions. Uniformly analyzing gut mucosal transcriptomics from 696 subjects, we have highlighted lncRNA expression along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, demonstrating that, in control samples, lncRNAs have a more location-specific expression in comparison with protein-coding genes. We defined dysregulation of lncRNAs in treatment-naive UC, CD, and celiac diseases using independent test and validation cohorts. Using the Predicting Response to Standardized Pediatric Colitis Therapy (PROTECT) inception UC cohort, we defined and prioritized lncRNA linked with UC severity and prospective outcomes, and we highlighted lncRNAs linked with gut microbes previously implicated in mucosal homeostasis. HNF1A-AS1 lncRNA was reduced in all 3 conditions and was further reduced in more severe UC form. Similarly, the reduction of HNF1A-AS1 ortholog in mice gut epithelia showed higher sensitivity to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, which was coupled with alteration in the gut microbial community. These analyses highlight prioritized dysregulated lncRNAs that can guide future preclinical studies for testing them as potential targets.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are autoimmune diseases characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation. Considered a western disease, IBD incidence in newly developed countries is skyrocketing. Accordingly, global prevalence is steadily increasing. There are two major IBD phenotypes, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). UC manifests as uninterrupted inflammation localized in the colon and rectum. Meanwhile, CD presents as interrupted inflammation that can occur throughout the digestive tract. As a result, therapeutics have focused on anti-inflammatory approaches for its treatment. Unfortunately, only 50% of patients benefit from current Food and Drug Administration approved treatments, and all are associated with serious adverse effects. Thus, there is a need for safer and novel therapeutics to increase the efficacy in this population. One aspect that is critical in understanding IBD is how food and phytochemicals therein may be associated with modifying the pathogenesis of IBD. A variety of retrospective and prospective studies, and clinical trials have shown benefits of plant-rich diets on the prevention and symptomatic improvement of IBD. The Mediterranean diet is rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes, and herbs; and characterized by the abundance of anti-inflammatory phytochemicals. An understudied phytochemical class enriched in this diet is terpenes; isoprene-based molecules are widely available in Mediterranean herbs and citrus fruits. Various terpenes have been evaluated in different IBD models. However, some present contradictory or inconclusive results. Therefore, in this review we evaluated preclinical studies of terpenes modulating basic inflammatory signaling related to IBD.",

IBD is associated with altered gut microbiota and their metabolites in the colon. Butyrate, a gut microbial metabolite, plays a crucial role in regulating immune function, epithelial barrier function, and intestinal homeostasis. In this review, we aim to present an overview of butyrate synthesis and metabolism and the mechanism of action of butyrate in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and to discuss the therapeutic implications of butyrate in IBD. <b>Methods:</b> We searched the literature up to March 2023 through PubMed, Web of Science, and other sources using search terms such as butyrate, inflammation, IBD, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Clinical studies in patients and preclinical studies in rodent models of IBD were included in the summary of the therapeutic implications of butyrate. <b>Results:</b> Research in the last two decades has shown the beneficial effects of butyrate on gut immune function and epithelial barrier function. Most of the preclinical and clinical studies have shown the positive effect of butyrate oral supplements in reducing inflammation and maintaining remission in colitis animal models and IBD patients. However, butyrate enema showed mixed effects. Butyrogenic diets, including germinated barley foodstuff and oat bran, are found to increase fecal butyrate concentrations and reduce the disease activity index in both animal models and IBD patients. <b>Conclusions:</b> The current literature suggests that butyrate is a potential add-on therapy to reduce inflammation and maintain IBD remission. Further clinical studies are needed to determine if butyrate administration alone is an effective therapeutic treatment for IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a group of chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Repeated inflammation can lead to complications, such as intestinal fistula, obstruction, perforation, and bleeding. Unfortunately, achieving durable remission and mucosal healing (MH) with current treatments is difficult. Stem cells (SCs) have the potential to modulate immunity, suppress inflammation, and have anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic effects, making them an ideal therapeutic strategy to target chronic inflammation and intestinal damage in IBD. In recent years, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown efficacy in treating IBD. In addition, numerous clinical trials have evaluated the efficiency of MSCs in treating the disease. This review summarizes the current research progress on the safety and efficacy of SC-based therapy for IBD in both preclinical models and clinical trials. We discuss potential mechanisms of SC therapy, including tissue repair, paracrine effects, and the promotion of angiogenesis, immune regulation, and anti-inflammatory effects. We also summarize current SC engineering strategies aimed at enhancing the immunosuppressive and regenerative capabilities of SCs for treating intestinal diseases.

        "Abstract": "Inflammation of the GI tract leads to compromised epithelial barrier integrity, which increases intestine permeability. A compromised intestinal barrier is a critical event that leads to microbe entry and promotes inflammatory responses. Inflammatory bowel diseases that comprise Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) show an increase in intestinal permeability. Nerolidol (NED), a naturally occurring sesquiterpene alcohol, has potent anti-inflammatory properties in preclinical models of colon inflammation. In this study, we investigated the effect of NED on MAPKs, NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, and intestine epithelial tight junction physiology using in vivo and in vitro models. The effect of NED on proinflammatory cytokine release and MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways were evaluated using lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Subsequently, the role of NED on MAPKs, NF-\u03baB signaling, and the intestine tight junction integrity were assessed using DSS-induced colitis and LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cell culture models. Our result indicates that NED pre-treatment significantly inhibited proinflammatory cytokine release, expression of proteins involved in MAP kinase, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways in LPS-stimulated RAW macrophages and DSS-induced colitis. Furthermore, NED treatment significantly decreased FITC-dextran permeability in DSS-induced colitis. NED treatment enhanced tight junction protein expression (claudin-1, 3, 7, and occludin). Time-dependent increases in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements reflect the formation of healthy tight junctions in the Caco-2 monolayer. LPS-stimulated Caco-2 showed a significant decrease in TEER. However, NED pre-treatment significantly prevented the fall in TEER measurements, indicating its protective role. In conclusion, NED significantly decreased MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways and decreased tight junction permeability by enhancing epithelial tight junction protein expression.",

        "Abstract": "Many preclinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of genetically modified probiotics (gm probiotics) in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This systematic review was performed to investigate the role of gm probiotics in treating IBD and to clarify the involved mechanisms. PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Medline were searched from their inception to 18 September 2022 to identify preclinical and clinical studies exploring the efficacy of gm probiotics in IBD animal models or IBD patients. Two independent researchers extracted data from the included studies, and the data were pooled by the type of study; that is, preclinical or clinical. Forty-five preclinical studies were included. In these studies, sodium dextran sulfate and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid were used to induce colitis. Eleven probiotic species have been genetically modified to produce therapeutic substances, including IL-10, antimicrobial peptides, antioxidant enzymes, and short-chain fatty acids, with potential therapeutic properties against colitis. The results showed generally positive effects of gm probiotics in reducing disease activity and ameliorating intestinal damage in IBD models; however, the efficacy of gm probiotics compared to that of wild-type probiotics in many studies was unclear. The main mechanisms identified include modulation of the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota, production of regulatory metabolites by beneficial bacteria, reduction of the pro- to anti-inflammatory cytokine ratio in colonic tissue and plasma, modulation of oxidative stress activity in the colon, and improvement of intestinal barrier integrity. Moreover, only one clinical trial with 10 patients with Crohn's disease was included, which showed that <i>L. lactis</i> producing IL-10 was safe, and a decrease in disease activity was observed in these patients. Gm probiotics have a certain efficacy in colitis models through several mechanisms. However, given the scarcity of clinical trials, it is important for researchers to pay more attention to gm probiotics that are more effective and safer than wild-type probiotics to facilitate further clinical translation.",

With this in mind, our aim was to compare the anti-inflammatory efficacy of a new molecule (MTADV) to that of corticosteroids in TNBS and DSS-induced colitis mice of both sexes in order to clarify further the response mechanism involved and the variability between sexes. The drugs were administered preventively and therapeutically, and real-time bioluminescence was performed for the in vivo time-course colitis monitoring. Morphometric data were also collected, and colonic cytokines and acute plasma phase proteins were analyzed by qRT-PCR and ELISA, respectively-bioluminescence images correlated with inflammatory markers. In the TNBS model, dexamethasone worked better in females, while MTADV improved inflammation in males. In DSS-colitis, both therapies worked similarly. Based on the molecular profiles, interaction networks were constructed to pinpoint the drivers of therapeutic response that were highly dependent on the sex. In conclusion, our results suggest the importance of considering sex in IBD preclinical drug screening.",

        "Abstract": "The \u03b17-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR) is a key protein in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) that links the nervous and immune systems. Initially, the pathway was discovered based on the observation that vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) reduced the systemic inflammatory response in septic animals. Subsequent studies form a foundation for the leading hypothesis about the central role of the spleen in CAP activation. VNS evokes noradrenergic stimulation of ACh release from T cells in the spleen, which in turn activates \u03b17nAChRs on the surface of macrophages. \u03b17nAChR-mediated signaling in macrophages reduces inflammatory cytokine secretion and modifies apoptosis, proliferation, and macrophage polarization, eventually reducing the systemic inflammatory response. A protective role of the CAP has been demonstrated in preclinical studies for multiple diseases including sepsis, metabolic disease, cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, endometriosis, and potentially COVID-19, sparking interest in using bioelectronic and pharmacological approaches to target \u03b17nAChRs for treating inflammatory conditions in patients. Despite a keen interest, many aspects of the cholinergic pathway are still unknown. \u03b17nAChRs are expressed on many other subsets of immune cells that can affect the development of inflammation differently. There are also other sources of ACh that modify immune cell functions. How the interplay of ACh and \u03b17nAChR on different cells and in various tissues contributes to the anti-inflammatory responses requires additional study. This review provides an update on basic and translational studies of the CAP in inflammatory diseases, the relevant pharmacology of \u03b17nAChR-activated drugs and raises some questions that require further investigation.",

        "Abstract": "Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, also known as jakinibs, are third-generation oral small molecules that have expanded the therapeutic options for the management of chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor, has spearheaded the new JAK class for IBD treatment. Unfortunately, serious adverse effects, including cardiovascular complications such as pulmonary embolism and venous thromboembolism or even death from any cause, have been reported for tofacitinib. However, it is anticipated that next-generation selective JAK inhibitors may limit the development of serious adverse events, leading to a safer treatment course with these novel targeted therapies. Nevertheless, although this drug class was recently introduced, following the launch of second-generation biologics in the late 1990s, it is breaking new ground and has been shown to efficiently modulate complex cytokine-driven inflammation in both preclinical models and human studies. Herein, we review the clinical opportunities for targeting JAK1 signaling in the pathophysiology of IBD, the biology and chemistry underpinning these target-selective compounds, and their mechanisms of actions. We also discuss the potential for these inhibitors in efforts to balance their benefits and harms.",

This systematic review aimed to investigate the effect of Mastic Chios supplementation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A systematic search was conducted following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines across PubMed/Medline and EBSCO databases until February 2023. Clinical studies that examined individuals of any age being diagnosed with IBD as well as preclinical studies using animals with experimental colitis were considered eligible for inclusion. Studies included were assessed for methodological quality. Eight articles were eligible for inclusion, with seven conducted in Greece and one study in Iran. Most of the studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one was a pilot study. The intervention period varied between 3 and 7 days for animal studies and 4 weeks to 6 months for human studies. Mastic Chios supplementation varied between 2.2 and 2.8\u2009g/day for clinical studies. The majority of studies concluded that Mastic Chios has significant antioxidant and inflammatory effects in IBD. This systematic review suggests that Mastic Chios may have a positive effect on the regulation and management of IBD. However, more high-quality clinical trials are needed to provide reliable and concrete conclusions about the effectiveness of Mastic Chios in this population. Such studies will further support the use of Mastic Chios as a reliable therapeutic option for IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a complex, clinically heterogeneous disease of multifactorial origin; there is no perfect pre-clinical model, little insight into the basis for such heterogeneity, and still no cure. To address these unmet needs, we sought to explore the translational potential of adult stem cell-derived organoids that not only retain their tissue identity, but also their genetic and epigenetic disease-driving traits. We prospectively created a biobank of CD patient-derived organoid cultures (PDOs) using biopsied tissues from colons of 34 consecutive subjects representing all clinical subtypes (Montreal Classification B1-B3 and perianal disease). PDOs were generated also from healthy subjects. Comparative gene expression analyses enabled benchmarking of PDOs as tools for modeling the colonic epithelium in active disease and revealed that despite the clinical heterogeneity there are two major molecular subtypes: immune-deficient infectious-CD [IDICD] and stress and senescence-induced fibrostenotic-CD [S2FCD]. The transcriptome, genome and phenome show a surprising degree of internal consistency within each molecular subtype. The spectrum of morphometric, phenotypic, and functional changes within the \"living biobank\" reveals distinct differences between the molecular subtypes. These insights enabled drug screens that reversed subtype-specific phenotypes, e.g., impaired microbial clearance in IDICD was reversed using agonists for nuclear receptors, and senescence in S2FCD was rectified using senotherapeutics, but not <i>vice versa</i> . Phenotyped-genotyped CD-PDOs may fill the gap between basic biology and patient trials by enabling pre-clinical Phase '0' human trials for personalized therapeutics. This work creates a prospectively biobanked phenotyped-genotyped Crohn's disease patient-derived organoids (CD-PDOs) as platforms for molecular subtyping of disease and for ushering personalized therapeutics. Prospectively biobanked CD-organoids recapitulate the disease epithelium in patientsThe phenome-transcriptome-genome of CD-organoids converge on two molecular subtypesOne subtype shows impaired microbial clearance, another increased cellular senescencePhenotyped-genotyped PDOs are then used for integrative and personalized therapeutics.",

We aimed to assess associations of serum proteins with future CD onset and with other biomarkers predicting CD risk in a healthy at-risk cohort. In a nested case-control study within the Crohn's and Colitis Canada Genetics Environment Microbial Project (CCC-GEM) cohort, which prospectively follows healthy first-degree relatives (FDRs), subjects who developed CD (n=71) were matched with four FDRs remaining healthy (n=284). Using samples at recruitment, serum protein profiles using the Olink Proximity Extension Assay platform was assessed for association with future development of CD and with other baseline biomarkers as follows: serum antimicrobial antibodies (AS: positive antibody sum) (Prometheus); faecal calprotectin (FCP); gut barrier function using the fractional excretion of lactulose-to-mannitol ratio (LMR) assay. We identified 25 of 446 serum proteins significantly associated with future development of CD. C-X-C motif chemokine 9 (CXCL9) had the highest OR with future risk of CD (OR=2.07 per SD, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.73, q=7.9e-5), whereas matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein had the lowest OR (OR 0.44, 95%\u2009CI 0.29 to 0.66, q=0.02). Notably, CXCL9 was the only analyte significantly associated with all other CD-risk biomarkers with consistent direction of effect (FCP: OR=2.21; LMR: OR=1.67; AS: OR=1.59) (q<0.05 for all).

        "Abstract": "At diagnosis, up to one-third of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have a complicated phenotype with stricturing (B2) or penetrating (B3) behavior or require early surgery. We evaluated protein biomarkers and antimicrobial antibodies in serum archived years before CD diagnosis to assess whether complicated diagnoses were associated with a specific serological signature. Prediagnosis serum was obtained from 201 patients with CD and 201 healthy controls. Samples were evaluated with a comprehensive panel of 1129 proteomic markers (SomaLogic) and antimicrobial antibodies. CD diagnosis and complications were defined by the International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision and Current Procedural Terminology codes. Cox regression models were utilized to assess the association between markers and the subsequent risk of being diagnosed with complicated CD. In addition, biological pathway and network analyses were performed. Forty-seven CD subjects (24%) had a B2 (n\u00a0= 36) or B3 (n\u00a0= 9) phenotype or CD-related surgery (n\u00a0= 2) at diagnosis. Subjects presenting with complicated CD at diagnosis had higher levels of antimicrobial antibodies six years before diagnosis as compared with those diagnosed with noncomplicated CD. Twenty-two protein biomarkers (reflecting inflammatory, fibrosis, and tissue protection markers) were found to be associated with complicated CD. Pathway analysis of the altered protein biomarkers identified higher activation of the innate immune system and complement or coagulation cascades up to six years before diagnosis in complicated CD. Proteins and antimicrobial antibodies associated with dysregulated innate immunity, excessive adaptive response to microbial antigens, and fibrosis precede and predict a complicated phenotype at the time of diagnosis in CD patients.",

Here, we present pregnancy outcomes from IBD clinical trials, incorporating 5 years of treatment in Crohn's disease (CD) and 2 in ulcerative colitis (UC). All patients in the clinical trials agreed to use adequate birth control and were discontinued from treatment upon pregnancy confirmation. Nonetheless, 39 pregnancies occurred with maternal ustekinumab exposure from 4 CD and 1 UC study. Maternal and neonatal outcomes and data are presented with summary statistics, where available. Of 1289 women who received \u22651 dose of ustekinumab, 39 maternal pregnancies with outcomes were reported (pregnancy cohort). Median maternal age was 28.0 years and median duration of ustekinumab treatment before pregnancy was 63.7 weeks with the last dose of ustekinumab administered prior to or during the first trimester (terminal half-life of ~3 weeks). Outcomes for the 39 pregnancies were: 26 live births (all normal newborns), 8 spontaneous abortions, and 5 elective abortions. No congenital anomalies were reported among normal newborns and no safety signals emerged with neonatal outcomes. Based on this series of 39 pregnancies with outcomes from IBD clinical trials, mothers treated with ustekinumab (limited to up to the first trimester) did not demonstrate a risk of negative outcomes. More data are needed to characterize the safety profile of ustekinumab use during pregnancy.",

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which primarily include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are characterized by chronic recurrent inflammation of intestinal tissues. Due to the multifactorial etiology of these diseases, the development of innovative treatment strategies that can effectively maintain remission and alleviate disease symptoms is a major challenge. In recent years, evidence for the regulatory role of miRNAs in the pathogenetic mechanisms of various diseases, including IBD, has been accumulating. In light of these findings, miRNAs represent potential innovative candidates for therapeutic application in IBD. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the role of miRNAs in regulating inflammatory responses, maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, and developing fibrosis in clinical and experimental IBD. The focus is on the existing literature, indicating potential therapeutic application of miRNAs in both preclinical experimental IBD models and translational data in the context of clinical IBD. To date, a large and diverse data set, which is growing rapidly, supports the potential use of miRNA-based therapies in clinical practice, although many questions remain unanswered.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and encompasses Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Women appear to have more severe and recurring symptoms of IBD compared to men, most likely due to hormonal fluctuations. Studies have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in the development of inflammation and there is evidence of colon mitochondrial alterations in IBD models and patients. In this study we have identified the presence of sex-specific colon mitochondrial dysfunction in a rat model of IBD. <b>Methods:</b> Eight-week-old male and female rats were treated with indomethacin to induce IBD and mitoTEMPO was administered daily either after or before induction of IBD and until euthanasia. Colons were collected for histology and mitochondrial experiments. Intact mitochondrial respiration, reactive oxygen species (mtROS), the activities of the individual electron transport complexes and the activities of the antioxidant enzymes were measured to assess mitochondrial function. <b>Results:</b> IBD male rats showed a decrease in citrate synthase activity, cardiolipin levels, catalase activity and an increase in mtROS production. IBD females show a decrease in intact colon mitochondrial respiration, colon mitochondria respiratory control ratio (RCR), complex I activity, complex IV activity, and an increase in mtROS. Interestingly, control females showed a significantly higher rate of complex I and II-driven intact mitochondrial respiration, MCFA oxidation, complex II activity, complex III activity, and complex IV activity compared to control males. The use of a mitochondrial-targeted therapy, mitoTEMPO, improved the disease and colon mitochondrial function in female IBD rats. However, in the males there was no observed improvement, likely due to the decrease in catalase activity. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study provides a better understanding of the role mitochondria in the development of IBD and highlights sex differences in colon mitochondrial function. It also opens an avenue for the development of strategies to re-establish normal mitochondrial function that could provide more options for preventive and therapeutic interventions for IBD.",

        "Abstract": "The therapeutic management of Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is highly challenging. Surgical resection is sometimes a necessary procedure even though it is often associated with postoperative recurrences (PORs). Tofacitinib, an orally active small molecule Janus kinase inhibitor, is an anti-inflammatory drug meant to limit PORs in CD. Whereas bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiota and the relevant IBD drug are crucial, little is known about the impact of tofacitinib on the gut microbiota. The HLA-B27 transgenic rat is a good preclinical model used in IBD research, including for PORs after ileocecal resection (ICR). In the present study, we used shotgun metagenomics to first delineate the baseline composition and determinants of the fecal microbiome of HLA-B27 rats and then to evaluate the distinct impact of either tofacitinib treatment, ileocecal resection or the cumulative effect of both interventions on the gut microbiota in these HLA-B27 rats. The results confirmed that the microbiome of the HLA-B27 rats was fairly different from their wild-type littermates. We demonstrated here that oral treatment with tofacitinib does not affect the gut microbial composition of HLA-B27 rats. Of note, we showed that ICR induced an intense loss of bacterial diversity together with dramatic changes in taxa relative abundances. However, the oral treatment with tofacitinib neither modified the alpha-diversity nor exacerbated significant modifications in bacterial taxa induced by ICR. Collectively, these preclinical data are rather favorable for the use of tofacitinib in combination with ICR to address Crohn's disease management when considering microbiota.",

        "Abstract": "Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is an established dietary treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) by alleviating inflammation and inducing remission. However, the mechanisms of action of EEN are incompletely understood. As CD is associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis, we investigated the effect of EEN on the microbiome in a rat model of CD-like colitis. The rat model of CD-like colitis was established by an intracolonic instillation of TNBS at 65 mg/kg in 250 \u00b5L of 40% ethanol. Sham control rats were instilled with saline. Rats were fed ad libitum with either regular pellet food or EEN treatment with a clear liquid diet (Ensure). Rats were euthanized at 7 days. Fecal pellets were collected from the distal colon for 16S rRNA sequencing analysis of gut microbiota. In addition, colon tissues were taken for histological and molecular analyses in all the groups of rats. EEN administration to TNBS-induced CD rats significantly improved the body weight change, inflammation scores, and disease activity index. The mRNA expression of IL-17A and interferon-\u03b3 was significantly increased in the colonic tissue in TNBS rats when fed with regular food. However, EEN treatment significantly attenuated the increase in IL-17A and interferon-\u03b3 in TNBS rats. Our 16S rRNA sequencing analysis found that gut microbiota diversity and compositions were significantly altered in TNBS rats, compared to controls. However, EEN treatment improved alpha diversity and increased certain beneficial bacteria such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Dubosiella</i> and decreased bacteria such as <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Enterorhabdus</i> in CD-like rats, compared to CD-like rats with the regular pellet diet. In conclusion, EEN treatment increases the diversity of gut microbiota and the composition of certain beneficial bacteria. These effects may contribute to the reduced inflammation by EEN in the rat model of CD-like colitis.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are chronic inflammatory conditions which cause significant patient morbidity. Local drug delivery to the colon can improve treatment efficacy and reduce side effects associated with IBD treatment. Smart drug delivery systems are designed to regulate the release of therapeutic agents at the desired site of action. pH-responsive drug carriers have been previously utilised for improved oral drug delivery beyond stomach harsh conditions. Additionally, the colon possesses a diverse microbiome secreting bioactive molecules e.g., enzymes, that can be exploited for targeted drug delivery. We herein synthesised and characterised a 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid copolymer, crosslinked with an azobenzyl crosslinker, that displayed pH- and enzyme-responsive properties. The swelling and drug release from hydrogel were analysed in pH\u00a01.2, 6.5 and 7.4 buffers, and in the presence of rat caecal matter using metronidazole and mesalamine as model BCS Class I and IV drugs, respectively. Swelling studies displayed pH-responsive swelling behaviour, where swelling was maximum at pH\u00a07.4 and minimum at pH\u00a01.2 (69\u00a0% versus 32\u00a0%). Consequently, drug release was limited in gastric and small intestinal conditions but increased significantly when exposed to colonic conditions containing caecal matter. This system displays promising capacity for achieving colon-targeted drug delivery with enhanced dissolution of poorly water-soluble drugs for local treatment of IBD and other colon-targeted therapies.",

However, the mechanism of action of EEN in CD is unclear. T helper 17 (Th17) immune response plays a critical role in CD. We hypothesized that EEN alleviates Th17 response by eliminating mechanical stress-induced expression of Th17-polarizing cytokines. A rat model of Crohn's-like colitis was established by intracolonic instillation of TNBS (65 mg/kg in 250 \u00b5L of 40% ethanol). Control rats were treated with saline. We characterized immunophenotypes and molecular changes of the colon in control and colitis rats with and without EEN treatment. Th17 differentiation was determined using coculture assays. TNBS instillation induced transmural inflammation with stenosis in the inflammation site and a marked increase of Th17-polarizing cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and osteopontin and the Th17 cell population in the mechanically distended preinflammation site (P-site). EEN treatment eliminated mechanical distention and the increase of IL-6, osteopontin, and Th17 response in the P-site. IL-6 and osteopontin expression was found mainly in the muscularis externa. Mechanical stretch of colonic smooth muscle cells in vitro induced a robust increase of IL-6 and osteopontin. When na\u00efve T cells were cultured with conditioned media from the P-site tissue or stretched cells, Th17 differentiation was significantly increased. Inhibition of IL-6, but not deletion of osteopontin, blocked the increase of Th17 differentiation. Mechanical stress induces Th17-polarizing cytokines in the colon. EEN attenuates Th17 immune response by eliminating mechanical stress-induced IL-6 in Crohn's-like colitis.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Background and Aims:</b> Gut smooth muscle dysfunctions contribute to symptoms such as abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and constipation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The mechanisms for muscle dysfunctions are incompletely understood. We tested the hypothesis that mechanical stress plays a role in muscle dysfunction in a rat model of Crohn's-like colitis where inflammatory stenosis leads to mechanical distention in the pre-inflammation site. <b>Methods:</b> Crohn's-like colitis was induced by intracolonic instillation of TNBS (65\u00a0mg/kg) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Control rats were instilled with saline. The rats were fed with either regular solid food or exclusively liquid diet. Rats were euthanized by day 7. <b>Results:</b> When rats were fed with solid food, TNBS treatment induced localized transmural inflammation with stenosis in the instillation site and marked distention with no inflammation in the pre-inflammation site of the colon. Smooth muscle contractility was suppressed, and expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) and production of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) were increased not only in the inflammation site but also in the pre-inflammation site. Liquid diet treatment, mimicking exclusive enteral nutrition, completely released mechanical distention, eliminated COX-2 expression and PGE<sub>2</sub> production, and improved smooth muscle contractility especially in the pre-inflammation site. When rats were administered with COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (5\u00a0mg/kg, i. p. daily), smooth muscle contractility was restored in the pre-inflammation site and significantly improved in the inflammation site. <b>Conclusion:</b> Colonic smooth muscle contractility is significantly impaired in stenotic Crohn's-like colitis rats not only in the inflammation site, but in the distended pre-inflammation site. Mechanical stress-induced expression of COX-2 plays a critical role in smooth muscle dysfunction in the pre-inflammation site in Crohn's-like colitis rats.",

        "Title": "Xue-Jie-San prevents the early development of colitis-associated intestinal fibrosis by blocking Notch1 and FGL1 signaling pathways.",
        "Abstract": "Xue-Jie-San (XJS), as a traditional Chinese herb prescription, has satisfactory effects on improving clinical symptoms and facilitating the healing of intestinal ulcers in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). This motivates the application of XJS on CD-associated complications. Intestinal fibrosis is a debilitating complication of CD. Currently, there is no effective medication available for preventing or reversing CD-related intestinal fibrosis. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of XJS in the treatment of colitis-associated intestinal fibrosis. A rat model of CD-related intestinal fibrosis was induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid administration and treated with XJS. The pathological changes of intestinal fibrosis were evaluated using Masson staining. Collagen deposition and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were verified by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis. Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) was assessed with immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining as well as Western blot analysis. Transmission electron microscopy was utilized to observe autophagosomes. The levels of autophagy-related proteins were detected via immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. Finally, the mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway regulated by Notch1 or FGL1 was analyzed by Western blot. The results found that XJS ameliorated intestinal fibrosis through reducing the deposition of collagens such as Collagen 1 and Collagen 3. XJS inhibited the EMT process by increasing E-cadherin levels and decreasing the expressions of N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail, which played a crucial role in collagen secretion and intestinal fibrosis. In addition, XJS also repressed the EndoMT process as reflected by the upregulation of CD31 and VE-cadherin levels and the downregulation of FSP1 and \u03b1-SMA expressions. Autophagy was activated following XJS treatment via suppression of the mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, XJS acted as an inhibitor of Notch1 and FGL1 signals, both of which regulated the mTOR signaling. Our findings validated that XJS prevented the early development of CD-related intestinal fibrosis by blocking the Notch1 and FGL1 signaling pathways to activate autophagy and thereby inhibit EMT and EndoMT.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is an incurable inflammatory bowel disease due to unclear etiology and pathogenesis. Accumulating evidences have shown the harmful role of ferroptosis in CD onset and development. Additionally, fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) has been verified to be a potential therapeutic target of CD. Xue-Jie-San (XJS) is an effective prescription for treating CD. However, its therapeutic mechanism has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to determine whether XJS alleviating CD via regulating ferroptosis and FGL1 expression. A colitis rat model was induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and treated with XJS. The disease activity indices of the colitis rats were scored. Histopathological damage was assessed using HE staining. ELISA was performed to examine inflammatory cytokines. Transmission electron microscopy was utilized to observe ultrastructure changes in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Iron load was evaluated by examining iron concentrations, the expressions of FPN, FTH and FTL. Lipid peroxidation was investigated through detecting the levels of ROS, 4-HNE, MDA and PTGS2. Furthermore, the SLC7A11/GSH/GPX4 antioxidant system and FGL1/NF-\u03baB/STAT3 signaling pathway were examined. The results showed that colitis was dramatically ameliorated in the XJS-treated rats as evidenced by relief of clinical symptoms and histopathological damages, downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1, and upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Furthermore, XJS administration led to ferroptosis inhibition in IECs by reducing iron overload and lipid peroxidation. Mechanistically, XJS enhanced the SLC7A11/GSH/GPX4 antioxidant system negatively regulated by the FGL1/NF-\u03baB/STAT3 positive feedback loop. In conclusion, XJS might restrain ferroptosis in IECs to ameliorate experimental colitis by inhibition of FGL1/NF-\u03baB/STAT3 positive feedback loop.",

        "Abstract": "To investigate the therapeutic mechanism of diosmetin on 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced Crohn's disease (CD)-like colitis in mice. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were randomized into control group, TNBS-induced CD-like colitis group (TNBS group) and 50 mg\u00b7kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7d<sup>-1</sup> diosmetin-treated group (<i>n</i>=8). Disease activity (DAI) scores, body weight changes, histological scores, colon lengths and colon mucosal levels of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-17A were measured to evaluate the severity of colitis. The changes of T lymphocyte subsets (Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg) in the mesenteric lymph nodes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Network pharmacology and molecular docking were used to analyze the effect of diosmetin on PI3K/AKT pathway. Compared with TNBS group, diosmetin treatment significantly lowered DAI scores, histological scores, body weight loss and colon mucosal levels of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-17A (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and increased the colon length of the rat models, but these improvements did not reach the control levels (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Diosmetin significantly lowered the percentages of Th1/Th17 cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes in TNBS-treated mice, which remained higher than the control levels (<i>P</i> < 0.05); The percentages of Th2/Treg cells were significantly higher in diosmetin group than in TNBS group (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and the control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Network pharmacologic analysis identified 46 intersection targets of diosmetin and CD, and among them AKT1, EGFR, SRC, ESR1, MMP9 and PTGS2 were the top 6 core targets. GO and KEGG analyses showed that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was closely related with the therapeutic effect of diosmetin on CD-like colitis. Molecular docking suggested strong binding of diosmetin to the key core targets. Diosmetin significantly reduced the levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT in the colon mucosa in TNBS-treated mice (<i>P</i> < 0.05), but their levels remained higher than those in the control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Diosmetin ameliorates TNBS-induced CDPlike colitis in mice possibly by regulating Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg balance to improve intestinal immune disorder through inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and encompasses Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Women appear to have more severe and recurring symptoms of IBD compared to men, most likely due to hormonal fluctuations. Studies have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in the development of inflammation and there is evidence of colon mitochondrial alterations in IBD models and patients. In this study we have identified the presence of sex-specific colon mitochondrial dysfunction in a rat model of IBD. Eight-week-old male and female rats were treated with indomethacin to induce IBD and mitoTEMPO was administered daily either after or before induction of IBD and until euthanasia. Colons were collected for histology and mitochondrial experiments. Intact mitochondrial respiration, reactive oxygen species (mtROS), the activities of the individual electron transport complexes and the activities of the antioxidant enzymes were measured to assess mitochondrial function. IBD male rats showed a decrease in citrate synthase activity, cardiolipin levels, catalase activity and an increase in mtROS production. IBD females show a decrease in intact colon mitochondrial respiration, colon mitochondria respiratory control ratio (RCR), complex I activity, complex IV activity, and an increase in mtROS. Interestingly, control females showed a significantly higher rate of complex I and II-driven intact mitochondrial respiration, MCFA oxidation, complex II activity, complex III activity, and complex IV activity compared to control males. The use of a mitochondrial-targeted therapy, mitoTEMPO, improved the disease and colon mitochondrial function in female IBD rats. However, in the males there was no observed improvement, likely due to the decrease in catalase activity. Our study provides a better understanding of the role mitochondria in the development of IBD and highlights sex differences in colon mitochondrial function. It also opens an avenue for the development of strategies to re-establish normal mitochondrial function that could provide more options for preventive and therapeutic interventions for IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Postoperative recurrence (POR) after ileocecal resection (ICR) affects most Crohn's disease patients within 3-5 years after surgery. Adherent-invasive <i>Escherichia coli</i> (AIEC) typified by the LF82 strain are pathobionts that are frequently detected in POR of Crohn's disease and have a potential role in the early stages of the disease pathogenesis. <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> CNCM I-3856 is a probiotic yeast reported to inhibit AIEC adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells and to favor their elimination from the gut. To evaluate the efficacy of CNCM I-3856 in preventing POR induced by LF82 in an HLA-B27 transgenic (TgB27) rat model. Sixty-four rats [strain F344, 38 TgB27, 26 control non-Tg (nTg)] underwent an ICR at the 12<sup>th</sup> wk (W12) of life and were sacrificed at the 18<sup>th</sup> wk (W18) of life. TgB27 rats were challenged daily with oral administration of LF82 (10<sup>9</sup> colony forming units (CFUs)/day (d), <i>n</i> = 8), PBS (<i>n</i> = 5), CNCM I-3856 (10<sup>9</sup> CFUs/d, <i>n</i> = 7) or a combination of LF82 and CNCM I-3856 (<i>n</i> = 18). nTg rats receiving LF82 (<i>n</i> = 5), PBS (<i>n</i> = 5), CNCM I-3856 (<i>n</i> = 7) or CNCM I-3856 and LF82 (<i>n</i> = 9) under the same conditions were used as controls. POR was analyzed using macroscopic (from 0 to 4) and histologic (from 0 to 6) scores. Luminal LF82 quantifications were performed weekly for each animal. Adherent LF82 and inflammatory/regulatory cytokines were quantified in biopsies at W12 and W18. Data are expressed as the median with the interquartile range. nTg animals did not develop POR. A total of 7/8 (87%) of the TgB27 rats receiving LF82 alone had POR (macroscopic score \u2265 2), which was significantly prevented by CNCM I-3856 administration [6/18 (33%) TgB27 rats, <i>P</i> = 0.01]. Macroscopic lesions were located 2 cm above the anastomosis in the TgB27 rats receiving LF82 alone and consisted of ulcerations with a score of 3.5 (2 - 4). Seven out of 18 TgB27 rats (39%) receiving CNCM I-3856 and LF82 had no macroscopic lesions. Compared to untreated TgB27 animals receiving LF82 alone, coadministration of CNCM I-3856 and LF82 significantly reduced the macroscopic [3.5 (2 - 4) <i>vs</i> 1 (0 - 3), <i>P</i> = 0.002] and histological lesions by more than 50% [4.5 (3.3 - 5.8) <i>vs</i> 2 (1.3 - 3), <i>P</i> = 0.003]. The levels of adherent LF82 were correlated with anastomotic macroscopic scores in TgB27 rats (<i>r</i> = 0.49, <i>P</i> = 0.006), with a higher risk of POR in animals having high levels of luminal LF82 (71.4% <i>vs</i> 25%, <i>P</i> = 0.02). Administration of CNCM I-3856 significantly reduced the levels of luminal and adherent LF82, increased the production of interleukin (IL)-10 and decreased the production of IL-23 and IL-17 in TgB27 rats. In a reliable model of POR induced by LF82 in TgB27 rats, CNCM I-3856 prevents macroscopic POR by decreasing LF82 infection and gut inflammation.",

We report an injectable, biodegradable, mechanically fragmented nanofiber-hydrogel composite (mfNHC) loaded with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for the treatment of fistulas in a rat model of CD-PAF. The ADSC-loaded mfNHC results in a higher degree of healing when compared to surgical treatment of fistulas, which is a standard treatment. The volume of fistulas treated with mfNHC is decreased sixfold compared to the surgical treatment control. Molecular studies reveal that utilization of mfNHC reduced local inflammation and improved tissue regeneration. This study demonstrates that ADSC-loaded mfNHC is a promising therapy for CD-PAF, and warrants further studies to advance mfNHC toward clinical translation.",

This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism by which moxibustion alleviates depressive behavior in rats with Crohn's disease (CD). The CD rat model was established with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. Treatment with moxibustion was applied to Tianshu (ST25, bilateral), Qihai (CV6), and Baihui (GV20) acupoints, and the effect of moxibustion was compared with that of the combination of moxibustion plus indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor, 1-methyltryptophan (1-MT). The effects of moxibustion and moxibustion plus 1-MT combination on colonic inflammation and depressive behavior (assessed by forced swimming test, sucrose preference test, and open field test) were investigated. The changes in IDO1, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 in rat colon and hippocampus were assessed by Western blot (WB). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, immunofluorescence staining, and WB were applied to detect kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolites, hippocampal neuronal activity, and microglia activation, respectively. Both moxibustion and moxibustion plus 1-MT combination significantly alleviated intestinal inflammation and depressive behavior, downregulated the levels of IDO1 in the colon and hippocampus, and inhibited inflammation-inducing factors IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, as well as the kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) ratio of KP metabolites, and upregulated the kynurenic acid (KYNA)/KYN ratio and the KYNA/quinolinic acid (QUIN) ratio in the hippocampus in rats with CD; Hippocampal ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1), c-fos protein expression, activated microglia, and neuronal activation was also significantly reduced by moxibustion and moxibustion plus 1-MT. The addition of 1-MT did not significantly increase the therapeutic effect of moxibustion. Moxibustion can improve depressive behavior in rats with CD, which may be related to its regulation of KP metabolism in the gut-brain axis and inhibition of hippocampal microglia activation and neuronal activation.",

        "Abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The disease has been linked with gut microbiota dysbiosis in which the balance of commensal communities is disrupted. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that treatment with biologically active compounds can modulate gut microbiota composition in animal models. Our previous work has also shown the beneficial effect of Luem Pua (LP) rice extract, which is rich in anthocyanins, on inflammation. However, its effect on gut microbiota is yet to be explored. In this study, we profiled fecal microbiota of acetic acid (AA)-induced UC and indomethacin (ID)-induced CD rat models with and without pretreatment with LP rice extract by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results showed that gut microbiota communities of rats were altered by both AA-induced UC and ID-induced CD. The relative abundances of beneficial bacteria, especially the Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group and Lactobacillus, were decreased in the AA-induced UC model, while some opportunistic pathogens (Bacteroides, Escherichia/Shigella, Fusobacterium, and Veillonella) were raised by ID-induced CD. Interestingly, pretreatment with LP rice extract before AA-inducing UC in rats increased the proportion of the butyrate-producing bacteria (Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group). The abundances of these beneficial bacteria and other SCFA-producing bacteria were unaffected by the indomethacin treatment with LP. Overall, our study revealed different impacts of AA-induced UC and ID-induced CD on changes in community composition and hinted at how LP may protect against UC by modifying the gut microbiota.",

        "Title": "HM15912, a Novel Long-Acting Glucagon-Like Peptide-2 Analog, Improves Intestinal Growth and Absorption Capacity in a Male Rat Model of Short Bowel Syndrome.",
        "Abstract": "Extensive bowel resection caused by various diseases that affect the intestines, such as Crohn's disease, volvulus, and cancer, leads to short bowel syndrome (SBS). Teduglutide is the only approved glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) drug for SBS; however, it requires daily administration. A novel GLP-2 analog with a prolonged duration of action to reduce dosing frequency and promote a greater efficacy may provide patients with a better quality of life. In the present study, the sustained exposure of HM15912 was characterized in normal male rats. The efficacy of HM15912 on intestinal growth and absorption capacity was also evaluated in normal male mice, rats, and SBS rats. HM15912 exhibited a remarkably extended half-life (42.3 hours) compared with teduglutide (0.6 hours) in rats. Despite somewhat lower in vitro potency on GLP-2 receptor than human GLP-2 or teduglutide, this longer-lasting mode of action promotes HM15912 to be more effective in terms of small intestinal growth than existing GLP-2 analogs even with a less frequent dosing interval of as little as once a week in rodents, including SBS rats. Furthermore, the small intestinal weight was approximately doubled, and the D-xylose absorption was significantly increased after pre-treatment of existing GLP-2 analogs on the market or under clinical development followed by HM15912 in rodents. These results indicate that HM15912 possesses a significant small bowel trophic effect driven by continuously increased exposure, supporting that HM15912 may be a novel treatment option with greater efficacy and the longest dosing interval among existing GLP-2 analogs for SBS with intestinal failure. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: HM15912, a novel long-acting glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) analog, has a significant small bowel hypertrophic effect in rodents with a reduced frequency of administration compared to the existing GLP-2 analogs on the market or currently under clinical development. This study supports the possibility that HM15912 could be administered much less frequently than other long-acting GLP-2 analogs for patients with short bowel syndrome.",

        "Abstract": "Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, such as tofacitinib (Xeljanz) and filgotinib (Jyseleca), have been approved for treatment of ulcerative colitis with several other JAK inhibitors in late-stage clinical trials for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite their impressive efficacy, the risk of adverse effects accompanying the use of JAK inhibitors has brought the entire class under scrutiny, leading to them receiving an FDA black box warning. In this study we investigated whether ileocolonic-targeted delivery of a pan-JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib, can lead to increased tissue exposure and reduced systemic exposure compared to untargeted formulations. The stability of tofacitinib in the presence of rat colonic microbiota was first confirmed. Next, in vivo computed tomography imaging was performed in rats to determine the transit time and disintegration site of ileocolonic-targeted capsules compared to gastric release capsules. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that systemic drug exposure was significantly decreased, and colonic tissue exposure increased at 10 mg/kg tofacitinib dosed in ileocolonic-targeted capsules compared to gastric release capsules and an oral solution. Finally, in a rat model of LPS-induced colonic inflammation, targeted tofacitinib capsules significantly reduced concentrations of proinflammatory interleukin 6 in colonic tissue compared to a vehicle-treated control (<i>p</i> = 0.0408), unlike gastric release tofacitinib capsules and orally administered dexamethasone. Overall, these results support further development of ileocolonic-targeted tofacitinib, and potentially other specific JAK inhibitors in pre-clinical and clinical development, for the treatment of IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and is globally increasing. An appropriate model system is required to dissect the disease pathogenesis and drugs screening for adequate treatment. In the present study, we established a novel model of gut inflammation by injecting peptidoglycan from Staphylococcus aureus using laparotomic procedure. For this, three different doses of peptidoglycan, i.e., 2.5, 5 and 10\u00a0mg/kg body weight were used. The treatment effect was evaluated by studying the macrophage phagocytic function, spleen lymphocytes' proliferation and qRT-PCR for the assessment of peritoneal cells' gene expression. In addition, histological analysis of gut sections, gastric acidity, immunoglobulins and cytokines were assessed. There was significant increase in phagocytic activity in 10\u00a0mg/kg body weight PGN group. A dose dependent increase in spleen lymphocytes' proliferation and a significant increase in total acid secretion in 5 and 10\u00a0mg/kg body weight PGN treated rats were observed. In addition, a significant increment in TLR-2 and CD-14 mRNA expression in peritoneal cells, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 level and maximum distortion of gut architecture was observed in 10\u00a0mg/kg body weight PGN group. Hence, peptidoglycan from S. aureus can be used for establishing the screening model to study the action and mechanism of anti-inflammatory food products and drugs.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that associates with, among others, increased risk of colorectal cancer. There is a growing evidence that miRNAs have important roles in pathological processes, such as inflammation or carcinogenesis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms such as alterations in microRNAome upon chronic intestinal inflammation is critical for understanding the exact pathomechanism of IBD. Hence, we conducted a genome wide microRNAome analysis by applying miRNA-Seq in a rat model of experimental colitis, validated the data by QPCR, examined the expression of a selection of precursor and mature miRNAs, performed in depth biological interpretation using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and tested the obtained results on samples derived from human patients. We identified specific, interdependent expression pattern of activator/repressor transcription factors, miRNAs and their direct targets in the inflamed colon samples. Particularly, decreased expression of the miR-200 family members (miR-200a/b/c,-141, and -429) and miR-27b correlates with the reduced level of their enhancers (HNF1B, E2F1), elevated expression of their repressors (ZEB2, NFKB1) and increased expression of their target genes (ZEB2, RUNX1). Moreover, the marked upregulation of six miR-27b target genes (IFI16, GCA, CYP1B1, RUNX1, MEF2C and MMP13) in the inflamed colon tissues is a possible direct consequence of the lack of repression due to the downregulated miRNA-27b expression. Our data indicate that changes in microRNAome are associated with the pathophysiology of IBD, consequently, microRNAs offer potential targets for the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract that are typically categorized into two subtypes: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Although MSCs therapy has achieved encouraging outcomes in IBD therapy, objective responses are limited in colon fibrosis stenosis owing to the complicated microenvironment of CD and MSCs heterogeneity of quality. Here, we chose IFN-\u03b3 and kynurenic acid (KYNA) to overcome the low response and heterogeneity of human adipose-derived MSCs (hADSCs) to treat IBD and expand the therapeutic effects based on the excellent ability of IFN-\u03b3 and KYNA to promote indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) signaling, providing a potential protocol to treat IBD and fibrosis disease. hADSCs were isolated, cultured, and identified from human abdominal adipose tissue. The CD pathology-like acute colitis and chronic colon fibrosis rat model was induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzen sulfonic acid (TNBS). hADSCs were pretreated in vitro with IFN-\u03b3 and KYNA and then were transplanted intravenously at day 1 and 3 of TNBS administration in colitis along with at day 1, 15, and 29 of TNBS administration in chronic colonic fibrosis. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by body weights, disease activity index, pathological staining, real-time PCR, Western blot, and flow cytometry. For knockout of IDO-1, hADSCs were transfected with IDO-1-targeting small gRNA carried on a CRISPR-Cas9-lentivirus vector. hADSCs treated with IFN-\u03b3 and KYNA significantly upregulated the expression and secretion of IDO-1, which has effectively ameliorated CD pathology-like colitis injury and fibrosis. Notably, the ability of hADSCs with IDO-1 knockout to treat colitis was significantly impaired and diminished the protective effects of the primed hADSCs with IFN-\u03b3 and KYNA. Inflammatory cytokines IFN-\u03b3- and KYNA-treated hADSCs more effectively alleviate TNBS-induced colitis and colonic fibrosis through an IDO-1-dependent manner. Primed hADSCs are a promising new strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs and worth further research.",

        "Abstract": "Visceral pain is a prominent feature of various gastrointestinal diseases. The P2X7 receptor is expressed by multiple cell types including dorsal root ganglion satellite glial cells, macrophages, and spinal microglia, all of which have been implicated in nociceptive sensitization. We have used the selective and CNS penetrant P2X7 receptor antagonist Lu AF27139 to explore this receptor's role in distinct rat models of inflammatory and visceral hypersensitivity. Rats injected with CFA in the hindpaw displayed a marked reduction in hindpaw mechanical threshold, which was dose-dependently reversed by Lu AF27139 (3-30\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.). In rats injected with TNBS in the proximal colon, the colorectal distension threshold measured distally was significantly lower than sham treated rats at 7\u00a0days post-injection (P\u2009<\u20090.001), indicative of a marked central sensitization. Colonic hypersensitivity was also reversed by Lu AF27139 (10-100\u00a0mg/kg) and by the \u03ba-opioid receptor agonist U-50,488H (3\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.). Moreover, both Lu AF27139 and U-50,488H prevented a TNBS-induced increase in spinal and brain levels of PGE2 and LTB4, as well as an increase in brain levels of PGF2\u03b1 and TXB2. Lu AF27139 was well tolerated as revealed by a lack of significant effect on rotarod motor function and coordination at all doses tested up to 300\u00a0mg/kg. Thus, P2X7 receptor antagonism is efficacious in a rat model of visceral pain, via a mechanism which potentially involves attenuation of microglial function within spinal and/or supraspinal pain circuits, albeit a peripheral site of action cannot be excluded.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic intestinal disturbance mediated by mucosal immune hyperactivity that is often associated with the formation of stenosis. No reliable solution to stenosis CD exists so far. Therefore, we generated carboxymethyl chitosan oligosaccharide (CMCOS) as a new promising therapy and investigate its efficacy in an improved rat CD model. CMCOS was synthesized by enzymatic hydrolysis, and its biosafety was evaluated in vivo. The rat model of stenosis CD was optimized by an orthogonal experiment of 75 or 100 mg/kg trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) in a 50 or 75% ethanol enema. The therapeutic efficacy of CMCOS on the rat model of stenosis CD was investigated and compared with the commercial drug 5-aminosalicylic acid over a 28 day period of disease progression. The rat model of stenosis CD was well established by intracolonic administration of 75 mg/kg TNBS in 75% ethanol. CMCOS significantly alleviated CD symptoms morphologically, hematologically, and pathologically, promoting functional recovery of intestinal epithelium in a dose-dependent manner. CMCOS reduced infiltrations of inflammatory cells by regulating the IL-17A/PPAR-\u03b3 pathway and reduced fibro-proliferation and fibro-degeneration of the colon tissue by downregulating the TGF-\u03b21/WT1 pathway. 75 mg/kg TNBS in a 75% ethanol enema induces a rat model of stenosis CD suitable for preclinical pathology and pharmacological studies. The safety, antifibrosis, and functional repair performance of CMCOS make it a promising candidate for the treatment of stenosis CD.",

Despite several surgical procedures, they relapse in about two-thirds of patients, mandating innovative treatments. Ultrasmall particles of iron oxide (USPIO) have been described to achieve in vivo rapid healing of deep wounds in the skin and liver of rats thanks to their nanobridging capability that could be adapted to fistula treatment. Our main purpose was to highlight preclinical data with USPIO for the treatment of perianal fistulizing CD. Twenty male Sprague Dawley rats with severe 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid solution (TNBS)-induced proctitis were operated to generate two perianal fistulas per rat. At day 35, two inflammatory fistulas were obtained per rat and perineal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. After a baseline MRI, a fistula tract was randomly drawn and topically treated either with saline or with USPIO for 1 min (<i>n</i> = 17 for each). The rats underwent a perineal MRI on postoperative days (POD) 1, 4, and 7 and were sacrificed for pathological examination. The primary outcome was the filling or closure of the fistula tract, including the external or internal openings. USPIO treatment allowed the closure and/or filling of all the treated fistulas from its application until POD 7 in comparison with the control fistulas (23%). The treatment with USPIO was safe, permanently closed the fistula along its entire length, including internal and external orifices, and paved new avenues for the treatment of perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease.",

        "Title": "Analysis of the Therapeutic Effect of Changyanning on Intestinal Flora in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.",
        "Abstract": "<i>Research Purposes</i>. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease coinduced by genes, environment, and immune response, mainly including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). There are a large number and variety of intestinal bacteria in the human intestinal tract. These bacteria maintain a balance with the human environment and participate in the normal physiological processes of the human body. They play a unique role in defending against pathogen invasion, maintaining the homeostasis of the human immune system and metabolizing substances. Intestinal flora imbalance may be one of the pathogenic factors of IBD, and restoring the disturbed intestinal flora has become a research hotspot in the prevention and treatment of IBD. Changyanning is mainly composed of Dijincao grass, yellow hairy ear grass, camphor tree roots, maple leaves, and so on. Clinical studies have shown that Changyanning alone or in combination has a significant effect on ulcerative colitis, but the treatment mechanism is not yet clear. In this study, we established an IBD animal model to explore the therapeutic mechanism of Changyanning on inflammatory bowel disease and its effect on intestinal flora. <i>Research Methods</i>. Male C57BL/6 SPF mice were given free access to 4% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) solution for 7 days to establish an ulcerative colitis model. After the model was established, different doses of Changyanning tablets, Changyanning granules, and sulfasalazine were given by gavage for 7 days. The relieving effects of the above drugs on the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease were evaluated by evaluating the mouse/rat body weight, survival rate, disease activity index, colon length, pathological tissue score, and other indicators. <i>Results</i>. The DSS-induced IBD mouse model showed significant increases in weight loss, DAI score, and pathological score. Both Changyanning tablets and granules can relieve the weight loss of mice, restore the colon length, and protect the colon tissue structure of mice. In reducing DAI and pathological scores in mice, Changyanning granules had a better effect. In conclusion, Changyanning can significantly improve the quality of life of IBD model animals, relieve intestinal inflammatory response, and relieve colonic edema, ulceration, and necrosis. The results show that Changyanning has a certain therapeutic effect on IBD. This study also provides experimental evidence for the application of Changyanning in the treatment of IBD, which is of great significance to its clinical application.

        "Abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a newly recognized endogenously generated gasotransmitter. Endogenous H2S has been shown to be related to several gastrointestinal diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. We explored the functional role of H2S in colitis and investigated the underlying mechanism. Rats were randomly divided into control, model, and sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) groups. Rat colitis was evaluated using the disease activity index and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The collected rat feces and intestinal charcoal transit were examined to determine intestinal motility. Enzyme-linked immunoassay kits were used to determine inflammatory factors in the rat blood. Calcium ion distribution and the protein expression of Potassium voltage gated channel subfamily D member 3 (KCND3), Maxi Potassium channel alpha (KCNMA1) and potassium inwardly rectifying channel J8 (KCNJ8) in rat smooth muscle were determined using an intracellular calcium detection kit, quantitative-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. The results showed that H2S donor NaHS improved the intestinal mucosa of colitis rats by alleviating the tissue edema and congestion and repairing the gland structure of the intestinal mucosa. NaHS also reduced the levels of inflammatory factors containing interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-6 in the rat blood. Additionally, the NaHS intervention partially restored rat intestinal motility by downregulating the proteins and mRNA expression of KCND3, KCNMA1, and KCNJ8 to reconstruct the ion channels. Our findings provide novel insights into the effect of H2S regulation on the anti-inflammatory action.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an inflammatory situation involving the whole digestive system. This illness includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. According to scientific research, the immune system plays an essential part in developing this disease. Recently, buspirone has been discovered to have anti-inflammatory properties. As a result, this research aims to see if buspirone provides anti-inflammatory effects in a rat model of TNBS-induced colitis. Control, TNBS, dexamethasone (2\u2009mg/kg), and buspirone (5, 10, and 20\u2009mg/kg) were randomly given to six groups of 36 male Wistar rats. Colitis was induced by intrarectal instillation of TNBS in all research groups except the control group, and rats were meliorated with dexamethasone and buspirone. Macroscopic and microscopic lesions appeared after colitis induction, while therapy with dexamethasone and buspirone significantly improved the lesions. TLR4 and pNF-\u03baB expression were also enhanced during colitis induction. On the other hand, the administration of dexamethasone or buspirone resulted in a considerable reduction in their expression. Tissue TNF-\u03b1 and MPO activity were enhanced after induction of colitis in terms of biochemical variables; however, administration of dexamethasone or buspirone reduced TNF-\u03b1 and MPO activity. Eventually, in an animal model of severe colitis, buspirone displayed anti-inflammatory characteristics via lowering the TLR4/NF-\u0138B signaling pathway's activity in an animal model of acute colitis.",

        "Abstract": "Mume Fructus (MF) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine used to treat chronic cough, prolonged diarrhea, and other inflammation-related diseases. We previously confirmed the anti-colitis effect of its ethanol extract on a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced Crohn's disease (CD) rat model. However, the active ingredients and underlying mechanisms of MF remain unknown. To clarify the material basis and potential mechanism of the ethanol extract of MF (MFE) in alleviating CD and its complications, such as lung injury and intestinal obstruction. MF was extracted with 80% ethanol aqueous solution and separated with 0, 40, and 100% ethanol aqueous solutions. MFE and its fractions were screened in a TNBS-induced CD rat model. For the bioactive fraction, the chemical composition was identified and quantified using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode-array detection and quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. Interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in the colon, lungs, and/or plasma were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The expression levels of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in the colon were measured using immunohistochemical staining, and the intestinal microbiota and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The 40% ethanol fraction of MF (MFE40), which mainly contained methyl citrate, ethyl citrate, and caffeoylquinic acid ethyl esters, was identified as the active fraction that could alleviate CD in rats. MFE40 could ameliorate inflammation and fibrosis in the colon and lung tissues by inhibiting the secretion of cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17, and TGF-\u03b2, along with intestinal obstruction and lung injury in CD rats. The possible mechanisms of MFE40 were related to increased expression of ZO-1 and occludin in the colon, reduction in plasma LPS levels, and restoration of SCFAs via reduction in the relative abundance of Adlercreutzia, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Erysipelatoclostridium, Faecalibaculum, norank_f_Erysipelotrichaceae, Phascolarctobacterium Coriobacteriaceae_UGG_002, and Allobaculum and increase in the relative abundance of Escherichia shigella, Christensenella, Acetivibrio_ethanolgignens, and Butyricicoccus. MFE40 had no significant influence on the inflammatory factors in healthy rats. Citrate esters and hydroxycinnamate esters are the main active constituents of MFE40. MFE40 exhibited a remission effect on CD rats and inhibited intestinal obstruction and lung injury via anti-inflammatory effects and regulation of the intestinal microbiota-gut-lung homeostasis.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic inflammation of the human intestine in Crohn's disease (CD) causes bowel wall thickening, which typically progresses to stricturing and a recurrent need for surgery. Current therapies have limited success and CD remains idiopathic and incurable. Recent evidence shows a key role of intestinal smooth muscle cell (ISMC) hyperplasia in stricturing, which is not targeted by current anti-inflammatory therapeutics. However, progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, resembling CD in pathophysiology, is controlled by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors nintedanib (NIN) or pirfenidone, and we investigated these drugs for their effect on ISMC. In a culture model of rat ISMC, NIN inhibited serum- and PDGF-BB-stimulated growth and cell migration, and promoted the differentiated phenotype, while increasing secreted collagen. NIN did not affect signaling through PDGF-R\u03b2 or NF\u03baB but did inhibit cytokine-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1, supporting a transcriptional level of control. In TNBS-induced colitis in mice, which resembles CD, NIN decreased ISMC hyperplasia as well as expression of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, without effect in control animals. NIN also inhibited growth of human ISMC in response to human serum or PDGF-BB, which further establishes a broad range of actions of NIN that support further trial in human IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Based on pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies, we explored the potential effect of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) -induced ulcerative colitis in mice and its underlying mechanism. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method was developed to measure the content of five components of GSPE in rat plasma and tissue. After oral administration of GSPE, correlative index levels of interleukin- 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), Nitric Oxide (NO), malonaldehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were detected in the serum and colon tissues. The protein expression levels of HO-1, Nrf2 and NF-\u03baB in the mouse colonic mucosa were analysed using immunohistochemistry. Pharmacodynamic tests showed substantially reduced mice body weight, diarrhea, and bloody stool in the model group. The pathological damage to the colonic mucosa of mice in the GSPE groups was remarkably reduced in a dose-dependent manner. The histopathological score of the colon in the model group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P <0.05), suggesting that DSS caused severe damage to the colon. After oral administration of GSPE, the serum and colonic tissue levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, NO, and MDA decreased, whereas SOD content increased. Moreover, the protein levels of NF-\u03baB and Keap-1 were significantly decreased, whereas the expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 proteins increased (P<0.01) based on the results of the microwaveimmunohistochemical assay. The pharmacokinetic results showed that catechin, epicatechin, and procyanidins B1, B2, and B4 are widely distributed in the tissues and blood of rats and may accumulate in some tissues. Catechin and epicatechin peaked at 0.25 and 1.5 h for the first and second time, respectively. Procyanidin B1, B2, and B4 peaked at 0.5 and 1.5 h for the first and second time, respectively, owing to the effect of the hepato-enteric circulation. The active components of GSPE can reach the colon of the lesion site, and hepatoenteric circulation can increase the residence time of the active components in the body, further increasing the anti-ulcer activity. Our findings suggest that GSPE has a potential protective effect against DSS-induced ulcerative colitis in mice.",

        "Abstract": "<i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> is one of the most abundant commensals of gut microbiota that is not commonly administered as a probiotic supplement. Being one of the gut's major butyrate-producing bacteria, its clinical significance and uses are on the rise and it has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and gut microbiota-modulating properties in the treatment of inflammatory bowel illness, Crohn's disease, and colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a silent killer disease that has become one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-tumorigenic and antiproliferative role of <i>F. prausnitzii</i> as well as to study its effects on the diversity of gut microbiota in rats. Findings showed that <i>F. prausnitzii</i> probiotic significantly reduced the colonic aberrant crypt foci frequency and formation in Azoxymethane (AOM)-induced CRC in rats. In addition, the administration of <i>F. prausnitzii</i> lowered the lipid peroxidation levels in the colon tissues. For in vitro 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, the cell-free supernatant of <i>F. prausnitzii</i> suppressed the growth of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells in a time/dose-dependent manner. 16S rRNA gene sequencing using rat stool samples showed that the administration of <i>F. prausnitzii</i> modulated the gut microbiota of the rats and enhanced its diversity. Hence, these findings suggest that <i>F. prausnitzii</i> as a probiotic supplement can be used in CRC prevention and management; however, more studies are warranted to understand its cellular and molecular mechanisms of action.",

The human commensal bacteria of the species Christensenella minuta (C. minuta) have been reported consistently missing in patients affected by Crohn's disease (CD) and have been documented to induce anti-inflammatory effects in human epithelial cells, supporting their potential as a novel biotherapy. This work aimed at selecting the most promising strain of C. minuta for future development as a clinical candidate for CD therapy. Here, we describe a complete screening process combining in vitro and in vivo assays to conduct a rational selection of a live strain of C. minuta with strong immunomodulatory properties. Starting from a collection of 32 strains, a panel of in vitro screening assays was used to narrow it down to five preclinical candidates that were further screened in vivo in an acute TNBS-induced rat colitis model. The most promising candidate was validated in vivo in two mouse models of colitis. The validated clinical candidate strain, C. minuta DSM 33715, was then fully characterized. Hence, applying a rationally designed screening algorithm, a novel strain of C. minuta was successfully identified as the most promising clinical candidate for CD.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two chronic relapsing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although there are several treatment options available to improve the symptoms of IBD patients, there is no effective treatment that provides a definitive solution. In the present study, we aim to investigate the antioxidative/anti-inflammatory effects of oral administration of boric acid and Bacillus clausii in a rat trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis model. The effects of boric acid and B. clausii were examined in serum and colon tissues with the help of some biochemical and histological analyses. Elevated inflammation and oxidative damage were found in the blood and colon tissue samples in the TNBS-induced group according to the complete blood count (CBC), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, interleukin-35 (IL-35), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitric oxide (NO), and histological findings. Particularly, the highest IL-35 level (70.09\u2009\u00b1\u200912.62\u00a0ng/mL) in the combined treatment group, highest catalase activity (5322\u2009\u00b1\u2009668.1 U/mg protein) in the TNBS-induced group, and lower relative expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in the TNBS-induced group than the control group were striking findings. According to our results, it can be concluded that boric acid showed more curative effects, even if B. clausii probiotics was partially ameliorative.",

        "Title": "Vagus Nerve Stimulation Reduces Indomethacin-Induced Small Bowel Inflammation.",
        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease is a chronic, idiopathic condition characterized by intestinal inflammation and debilitating gastrointestinal symptomatology. Previous studies of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), primarily in colitis, have shown reduced inflammation after electrical or pharmacological activation of the vagus nerve, but the scope and kinetics of this effect are incompletely understood. To investigate this, we studied the effect of electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in a rat model of indomethacin-induced small intestinal inflammation. 1 min of VNS significantly reduced small bowel total inflammatory lesion area [(mean \u00b1 SEM) sham: 124 \u00b1 14 mm<sup>2</sup>, VNS: 62 \u00b1 14 mm<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.002], intestinal peroxidation and chlorination rates, and intestinal and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels as compared with sham-treated animals after 24 h following indomethacin administration. It was not known whether this observed reduction of inflammation after VNS in intestinal inflammation was mediated by direct innervation of the gut or if the signals are relayed through the spleen. To investigate this, we studied the VNS effect on the small bowel lesions of splenectomized rats and splenic nerve stimulation (SNS) in intact rats. We observed that VNS reduced small bowel inflammation also in splenectomized rats but SNS alone failed to significantly reduce small bowel lesion area. Interestingly, VNS significantly reduced small bowel lesion area for 48 h when indomethacin administration was delayed. Thus, 1 min of electrical activation of the vagus nerve reduced indomethacin-induced intestinal lesion area by a spleen-independent mechanism. The surprisingly long-lasting and spleen-independent effect of VNS on the intestinal response to indomethacin challenge has important implications on our understanding of neural control of intestinal inflammation and its potential translation to improved therapies for IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Fibrostenosis is a serious complication of Crohn's disease (CD), affecting approximately one-half of all patients. Surgical resection is the typical clinical end due to ineffective antifibrotic therapy mainly through anti-inflammatory treatment and fibrosis can be reverted only at early stages. Mover, human fibrotic disorders is known to be associated with aging process. Thus, accurate monitoring of the progression of fibrosis is crucial for CD management as well as can be benefit to aging related fibrosis. The excessive deposition of type I collagen (ColI) is the core point in major complications of fibrosis, including that in patients with CD and aging related fibrosis. Therefore, a MR imaging probe (EP-3533) targeted ColI was employed to stage bowel fibrosis in CD using a rat model and to compare its efficiency with the common MR imaging contrast medium gadopentetatedimeglumine (Gd-DTPA). The bowel fibrotic rat model was established with different degrees of bowel fibrosis, were scanned using a 3.0-T MRI scanner with a specialized animal coil. MRI sequence including <i>T</i> <sub><i>1</i></sub> mapping and T1-weighed imaging were performed before and after injecting the MRI probe (EP-3533 or Gd-DTPA). The <i>T</i> <sub><i>1</i></sub> relaxation time (<i>T</i> <sub><i>1</i></sub> value) and change in the contrast-to-noise ratio (\u0394CNR) were measured to evaluate bowel fibrosis. Masson's trichrome staining was performed to determine the severity of fibrosis. EP-3533 offered a better longitudinal relaxivity (r<sub>1</sub>) with 67.537\u00a0L/mmol\u00b7s, which was approximately 13 times that of Gd-DTPA. The <i>T</i> <sub><i>1</i></sub> value on bowel segments was reduced in the images from EP-3533 compared to that from Gd-DTPA (F = 16.478; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Additionally, a better correlation between \u0394CNR calculated from EP-3533 imaging and bowel fibrosis (AUC = 0.846) was determined 10\u00a0min after enhanced media administration than with Gd-DTPA (AUC = 0.532). The 10th-minute \u0394CNR performed using the ColI probe showed the best correlation with the severity of bowel fibrosis (<i>r</i> = 0.538; <i>p</i> = 0.021). Our results demonstrates that targeted MRI probe (EP-3533) supplies a better enhanced effect compared to Gd-DTPA and could be a promising method to evaluate the progression and monitor the therapeutic response of bowel fibrosis.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract that include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and affect enteric neurons. Research has shown that Brilliant Blue G (BBG), a P2X7 receptor antagonist, restores enteric neurons following ischemia and reperfusion. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of BBG on myenteric neurons of the distal colon in an experimental rat model of ulcerative colitis. Colitis was induced by injection of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) into the large intestine. BBG was administered 1\u00a0h after colitis induction and for five consecutive days thereafter. Distal colons were collected 24\u00a0h or 7 days after TNBS injection. The animals were divided into 24-h and 7-day sham (vehicle injection rather than colitis induction), 24-h colitis, 24-h BBG, 7-day colitis and 7-day BBG groups. The disease activity index (DAI), neuronal density and profile of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)- and P2X7 receptor-immunoreactive enteric neurons were analyzed, and histological analysis was performed. The results showed recovery of the DAI and histological tissue integrity in the BBG groups compared to those in the colitis groups. In addition, the numbers of neurons positive for nNOS, ChAT and the P2X7 receptor per area were decreased in the colitis groups, and these measures were recovered in the BBG groups. Neuronal size was increased in the colitis groups and restored in the BBG groups. In conclusion, BBG is effective in improving experimental ulcerative colitis, and the P2X7 receptor may be a therapeutic target.",

        "Abstract": "Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are classified as chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with known extraintestinal manifestations. The interplay between heart and gut in IBD has previously been noted, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Our objective was to identify microRNAs mediating molecular remodeling and resulting cardiac impairment in a rat model of colitis. To induce chronic colitis, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was given to adult rats for 5 days followed by 9 days with normal drinking water for 4 cycles over 8 weeks. Echocardiography was performed to evaluate heart function. DSS-induced colitis led to a significant decrease in ejection fraction, increased left ventricular mass and size, and elevated B-type natriuretic protein. MicroRNA profiling showed a total of 56 miRNAs significantly increased in the heart by colitis, 8 of which are predicted to target brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). RT-qPCR validated the increases of miR-1b, Let-7d, and miR-155. Transient transfection revealed that miR-155 significantly suppresses BDNF in H9c2 cells. Importantly, DSS colitis markedly decreased BDNF in both myocardium and serum. Levels of various proteins critical to cardiac homeostasis were also altered. Functional studies showed that BDNF increases cell viability and mitigates H2O2-induced oxidative damage in H9c2 cells, demonstrating its protective role in the adult heart. Mechanistically, cellular experiments identified IL-1\u03b2 as the inflammatory mediator upregulating cardiac miR-155; this effect was confirmed in adult rats. Furthermore, IL-1\u03b2 neutralizing antibody ameliorated the DSS-induced increase in miR-155 and concurrent decrease in BDNF in the adult heart, showing therapeutic potential. Our findings indicate that chronic colitis impairs heart function through an IL-1\u03b2\u2192miR-155\u2192BDNF signaling axis.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease is defined as chronic noninfectious inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Its incidence and predominance have increased globally, with no effective agents for preventing its recurrence or treatment until now. The current study aimed to investigate the possible role of canagliflozin (CANA), a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2), to prevent and treat acetic acid (AA)-induced colitis in a rat model. Colitis was induced in male Wistar rats by intrarectal instillation of 1\u00a0ml of 4% (v/v) AA. Rats were treated orally with either CANA (30\u00a0mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 10 days before or after colitis induction or sulfasalazine (360\u00a0mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 10 days before colitis induction. AA resulted in a significant increase in disease activity index, colonic weight over length ratio, colon macroscopic damage score, and histological signs of colitis. All of these effects were significantly decreased by CANA administration. Additionally, CANA markedly inhibited AA-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses by significantly reducing the up-regulated levels in malondialdehyde, total nitrite, NF-\u03baB, interleukin-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1, and significantly increasing the down-regulated levels in reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and interleukin-10. CANA significantly inhibited caspase-3 level while rescued survivin expression in colons. Finally, CANA reduced the elevated levels of pyruvic acid and G6PDH activity, as well as the levels of p22phox and NOX2 in the AA-induced colitis. Our findings provide novel evidence that CANA has protective and therapeutic effects against AA-induced colitis by the impact of its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects.",

        "Abstract": "<i>ATG16L1</i> is a ubiquitous autophagy gene responsible, in part, for formation of the double-membrane bound autophagosome that delivers unwanted cellular debris and intracellular pathogens to the lysosome for degradation. A single, nonsynonymous adenine to guanine polymorphism resulting in a threonine to alanine amino acid substitution (T300A) directly preceded by a caspase cleavage site (DxxD) causes an increased susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD) in humans. The mechanism behind this increased susceptibility is still being elucidated, however, the amino acid change caused by this point mutation results in increased ATG16L1 protein sensitivity to caspase 3-mediated cleavage. To generate novel rat strains carrying genetic alterations in the rat <i>Atg16l1</i> gene, we first characterized the wild-type rat gene. We identified four alternative splice variants with tissue-specific expression. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology, we developed a knock-in rat model for the human <i>ATG16L1</i> T300A CD risk polymorphism, as well as a knock-out rat model to evaluate the role of <i>Atg16l1</i> in autophagy as well as its potential effect on CD susceptibility. These are the first reported rat strains with alterations of the <i>Atg16l1</i> gene. Consistent with studies of the effects of human <i>ATG16L1</i> polymorphisms, models exhibit morphological abnormalities in both Paneth and goblet cells, but do not develop spontaneous intestinal permeability or inflammatory bowel disease. Analysis of the gut microbiota does not show inherent differences in bacterial composition between wild-type and genetically modified animals. These <i>Atg16l1</i> strains are valuable new animal models for the study of both autophagy and CD susceptibility.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD), a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), emerges with severe gastrointestinal (GI) tract inflammation, sometimes known as hostile abdomen. Conventional treatment of CD has several limitations such as insufficient response to treatment, and intolerable side effects of drugs. In addition, the high cost of biologic drugs prevents patients from continuing their treatment. Dapsone showed vigorous anti-inflammatory effects on the skin diseases, lung diseases and inflammatory diseases of the nervous system. Hence, we decided to investigate the effect of dapsone on animal model of CD. In this study, colitis was induced by instillation of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) 100 mg/kg. Rats were treated with daily gavage of dapsone (10, 12.5 and 20 mg/kg). Seven days after induction of colitis, specimens were collected for pathological and molecular assessments. Dapsone (12.5 and 20 mg/kg) preserved the histologic architecture of the colon and prevented crypts irregularity. Additionally, it decreased tissue edema and hindered inflammatory cells infiltration. Besides, all doses of dapsone decreased tissue concentration of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interferon \u03b3 (INF\u03b3). Western blot revealed that dapsone could attenuate inflammation via downregulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and dephosphorylation of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB). Based on these findings, dapsone attenuates inflammation and decreases TNF-\u03b1 and INF-\u03b3 in animal model of CD. It acts through TLR4/NF-kB pathway to exert these effects.",

        "Abstract": "What is the central question of this study? Does peripheral non-invasive focused ultrasound targeted to the celiac plexus improve inflammatory bowel disease? What is the main finding and its importance? Peripheral non-invasive focused ultrasound targeted to the celiac plexus in a rat model of ulcerative colitis improved stool consistency and reduced stool bloodiness, which coincided with a longer and healthier colon than in animals without focused ultrasound treatment. The findings suggest that this novel neuromodulatory technology could serve as a plausible therapeutic approach for improving symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease. Individuals suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experience significantly diminished quality of life. Here, we aim to stimulate the celiac plexus with non-invasive peripheral focused ultrasound (FUS) to modulate the enteric cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. This approach may have clinical utility as an efficacious IBD treatment given the non-invasive and targeted nature of this therapy. We employed the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of colitis, administering lower (5%) and higher (7%) doses to rats in drinking water. FUS on the celiac plexus administered twice a day for 12 consecutive days to rats with severe IBD improved stool consistency scores from 2.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 to 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0 with peak efficacy on day 5 and maximum reduction in gross bleeding scores from 1.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 to 0.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 on day 6. Similar improvements were seen in animals in the low dose DSS group, who received FUS only once daily for 12\u00a0days. Moreover, animals in the high dose DSS group receiving FUS twice daily maintained colon length (17.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0cm), while rats drinking DSS without FUS exhibited marked damage and shortening of the colon (13.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0cm) as expected. Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17, tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3 were reduced with DSS but coincided with control levels after FUS, which is plausibly due to a loss of colon crypts in the former and healthier crypts in the latter. Lastly, overall, these results suggest non-invasive FUS of peripheral ganglion can deliver precision therapy to improve IBD symptomology.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract with alternating periods of exacerbation and remission. The aim of this study was to determine the time-dependent effects of dietary oat beta-glucans on colon apoptosis and autophagy in the CD rat model. A total of 150 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two main groups: healthy control (H) and a TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzosulfonic acid)-induced colitis (C) group, both including subgroups fed with feed without beta-glucans (\u03b2G-) or feed supplemented with low- (\u03b2Gl) or high-molar-mass oat beta-glucans (\u03b2Gh) for 3, 7, or 21 days. The expression of autophagy (LC3B) and apoptosis (Caspase-3) markers, as well as Toll-like (TLRs) and Dectin-1 receptors, in the colon epithelial cells, was determined using immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The results showed that in rats with colitis, after 3 days of induction of inflammation, the expression of Caspase-3 and LC3B in intestinal epithelial cells did not change, while that of TLR 4 and Dectin-1 decreased. Beta-glucan supplementation caused an increase in the expression of TLR 5 and Dectin-1 with no changes in the expression of Caspase-3 and LC3B. After 7 days, a high expression of Caspase-3 was observed in the colitis-induced animals without any changes in the expression of LC3B and TLRs, and simultaneously, a decrease in Dectin-1 expression was observed. The consumption of feed with \u03b2Gl or \u03b2Gh resulted in a decrease in Caspase-3 expression and an increase in TLR 5 expression in the C\u03b2Gl group, with no change in the expression of LC3B and TLR 4. After 21 days, the expression of Caspase-3 and TLRs was not changed by colitis, while that of LC3B and Dectin-1 was decreased. Feed supplementation with \u03b2Gh resulted in an increase in the expression of both Caspase-3 and LC3B, while the consumption of feed with \u03b2Gh and \u03b2Gl increased Dectin-1 expression. However, regardless of the type of nutritional intervention, the expression of TLRs did not change after 21 days. Dietary intake of \u03b2Gl and \u03b2Gh significantly reduced colitis by time-dependent modification of autophagy and apoptosis, with \u03b2GI exhibiting a stronger effect on apoptosis and \u03b2Gh on autophagy. The mechanism of this action may be based on the activation of TLRs and Dectin-1 receptor and depends on the period of exacerbation or remission of CD.",

        "Abstract": "Impaired intestinal epithelial barrier is highly affected in inflammatory bowel disease. Transmembrane collagens connecting the epithelial cells to the extracellular matrix have an important role in epithelial cell homeostasis. Thus, we sought to determine whether the transmembrane type 23 collagen could serve as a surrogate marker for disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. We developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect the ectodomain of type 23 collagen (PRO-C23) in serum, followed by evaluation of its levels in both acute and chronic dextran sulphate sodium colitis models in rats and human inflammatory bowel disease cohorts. Serum from 44 Crohn's disease and 29 ulcerative colitis patients with active and inactive disease was included. In the acute and chronic dextran sulphate sodium-induced rat colitis model, the PRO-C23 serum levels were significantly increased after colitis and returned to normal levels after disease remission. Serum levels of PRO-C23 were elevated in Crohn's disease (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and ulcerative colitis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) patients with active disease compared to healthy donors. PRO-C23 differentiated healthy donors from ulcerative colitis (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.81, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0009) and Crohn's disease (AUC: 0.70, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0124). PRO-C23 differentiated ulcerative colitis patients with active disease from those in remission (AUC: 0.75, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0219) and Crohn's disease patients with active disease from those in remission (AUC: 0.68, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). PRO-C23 was elevated in rats with active colitis, and inflammatory bowel disease patients with active disease. Therefore, PRO-C23 may be used as a surrogate marker for monitoring disease activity in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which affects gastrointestinal tract. The immune-mediated inflammation is mostly considered as the pathogenesis of IBD. It has been demonstrated that amitriptyline exerts anti-inflammatory influence; therefore, the aim of the current experiment is to evaluate the anti-inflammatory impact of amitriptyline on intestinal disorders following acetic acid-induced colitis in rats. Thirty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups, including sham, control, dexamethasone (2\u00a0mg/kg), and amitriptyline (10 and 20\u00a0mg/kg). Intrarectal administration of acetic acid was applied to colitis induction in all study groups except for sham group. Animals were treated by oral administration of dexamethasone or amitriptyline. While macroscopic and microscopic lesions appeared after colitis induction treatment with dexamethasone and amitriptyline 10 and 20\u00a0mg/kg significantly improved lesions. Moreover, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor binding kappa light-chain (NF-\u0138B expression), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) level, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were increased after colitis induction, whereas treatment with dexamethasone (2\u00a0mg/kg) or amitriptyline (10 and 20\u00a0mg/kg) caused a noticeable decrease in the TLR4 and pNF-\u0138B expression, TNF-\u03b1 level, and MPO activity. In conclusion, amitriptyline plays an anti-inflammatory role through the suppression of TLR4/pNF-\u0138B signaling pathway in the rat model of acute colitis.",

It is in development as a novel treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To measure TGF\u03b2 levels in blood and tissue after oral administration of encapsulated TGF\u03b2. Animals were orally administered encapsulated TGF\u03b2 by gavage. Levels of drug substance in blood and in gut tissues at various times after administration were measured by ELISA. We made the surprising discovery that oral administration of TreXTAM dramatically (approximately 50%) and significantly (<i>P</i> = 0.025) reduced TGF\u03b2 levels in colon, but not small intestine or mesenteric lymph nodes. Similarly, levels in rat serum after 25 d of thrice weekly dosing with either TreXTAM, or microencapsulated TGF\u03b2 alone (denoted as TPX6001) were significantly (<i>P</i> < 0.01) reduced from baseline levels. When tested in the SCID mouse CD4+CD25- adoptive cell transfer (ACT) model of IBD, oral TPX6001 alone provided only a transient benefit in terms of reduced weight loss. These observations suggest a negative feedback mechanism in the gut whereby local delivery of TGF\u03b2 results in reduced local and systemic levels of the active form of TGF\u03b2. Our findings suggest potential clinical implications for use of encapsulated TGF\u03b2, perhaps in the context of IBD and/or other instances of fibrosis and/or pathological TGF\u03b2 signaling.",

        "Title": "Herbal cake-partitioned moxibustion inhibits colonic autophagy in Crohn's disease <i>via</i> signaling involving distinct classes of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases.",
        "Abstract": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved biological process in eukaryotic cells that involves lysosomal-mediated degradation and recycling of related cellular components. Recent studies have shown that autophagy plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). Herbal cake-partitioned moxibustion (HM) has been historically practiced to treat CD. However, the mechanism by which HM regulates colonic autophagy in CD remains unclear. To observe whether HM can alleviate CD by regulating colonic autophagy and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Rats were randomly divided into a normal control (NC) group, a CD group, an HM group, an insulin + CD (I + CD) group, an insulin + HM (I + HM) group, a rapamycin + CD (RA + CD) group, and a rapamycin + HM (RA + HM) group. 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid was administered to establish a CD model. The morphology of the colonic mucosa was observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining, and the formation of autophagosomes was observed by electron microscopy. The expression of autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B) was observed by immunofluorescence staining. Insulin and rapamycin were used to inhibit and activate colonic autophagy, respectively. The mRNA expression levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class I (<i>PI3KC1</i>), <i>Akt1</i>, <i>LC3B</i>, sequestosome 1 (<i>p62</i>), and mammalian target of rapamycin (<i>mTOR</i>) were evaluated by RT-qPCR. The protein expression levels of interleukin 18 (IL-18), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), nuclear factor \u03baB/p65 (NF-\u03baB p65), LC3B, p62, coiled-coil myosin-like BCL2-interacting protein (Beclin-1), p-mTOR, PI3KC1, class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KC3/Vps34), and p-Akt were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Compared with the NC group, the CD group showed severe damage to colon tissues and higher expression levels of IL-18 and NF-\u03baB p65 in colon tissues (<i>P</i> < 0.01 for both). Compared with the CD group, the HM group showed significantly lower levels of these proteins (<i>P</i> <sub>IL-18</sub> < 0.01 and <i>P</i> <sub>p65</sub> < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the expression of TNF-\u03b1 protein in colon tissue among the rat groups. Typical autophagic vesicles were found in both the CD and HM groups. The expression of the autophagy proteins LC3B and Beclin-1 was upregulated (<i>P</i> < 0.01 for both) in the colon tissues of rats in the CD group compared with the NC group, while the protein expression of p62 and p-mTOR was downregulated (<i>P</i> < 0.01 for both). However, these expression trends were significantly reversed in the HM group compared with the CD group (<i>P</i> <sub>LC3B</sub> < 0.01, <i>P</i> <sub>Beclin-1</sub> < 0.05, <i>P</i> <sub>p62</sub> < 0.05, and <i>P</i> <sub>m-TOR</sub> < 0.05). Compared with those in the RA + CD group, the mRNA expression levels of <i>PI3KC1</i>, <i>Akt1</i>, <i>mTOR</i>, and <i>p62</i> in the RA + HM group were significantly higher (<i>P</i> <sub>PI3KC1</sub> < 0.01 and <i>P</i> <sub>Akt1, mTOR, and p62</sub> < 0.05), while those of LC3B were significantly lower (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Compared with the RA + CD group, the RA + HM group exhibited significantly higher PI3KC1, p-Akt1, and p-mTOR protein levels (<i>P</i> <sub>PI3KC1</sub> < 0.01, <i>P</i> <sub>p-Akt1</sub> < 0.05, and <i>P</i> <sub>p-mTOR</sub> < 0.01), a higher p62 protein level (<i>P</i> = 0.057), and significantly lower LC3B and Vps34 protein levels (<i>P</i> < 0.01 for both) in colon tissue. HM can activate PI3KC1/Akt1/mTOR signaling while inhibiting the PI3KC3 (Vps34)-Beclin-1 protein complex in the colon tissues of CD rats, thereby inhibiting overactivated autophagy and thus exerting a therapeutic effect.",

        "Abstract": "Conventional Crohn's disease (CD) treatments are supportive rather than curative and have serious side effects. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) have been gradually applied to treat various diseases. The therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism of ADSCs on CD are still not clear. To investigate the effect of ADSC administration on CD and explore the potential mechanisms. Wistar rats were administered with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) to establish a rat model of CD, followed by tail injections of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-modified ADSCs. Flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, and Western blot were used to detect changes in the Wnt signaling pathway, T cell subtypes, and their related cytokines. The isolated cells showed the characteristics of ADSCs, including spindle-shaped morphology, high expression of CD29, CD44, and CD90, low expression of CD34 and CD45, and osteogenic/adipogenic ability. ADSC therapy markedly reduced disease activity index and ameliorated colitis severity in the TNBS-induced rat model of CD. Furthermore, serum anti-sacchromyces cerevisiae antibody and p-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody levels were significantly reduced in ADSC-treated rats. Mechanistically, the GFP-ADSCs were colocalized with intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in the CD rat model. GFP-ADSC delivery significantly antagonized TNBS-induced increased canonical Wnt pathway expression, decreased noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway expression, and increased apoptosis rates and protein level of cleaved caspase-3 in rats. In addition, ADSCs attenuated TNBS-induced abnormal inflammatory cytokine production, disturbed T cell subtypes, and their related markers in rats. Successfully isolated ADSCs show therapeutic effects in CD by regulating IEC proliferation, the Wnt signaling pathway, and T cell immunity.",

Its pathogenesis is mainly an immune-mediated inflammation. Recently, it has been indicated that bupropion possesses anti-inflammatory properties; hence, the objective of this experiment is the investigation of the anti-inflammatory influence of bupropion on colonic lesions that emerged following the intrarectal administration of acetic acid. Thirty-six male Wistar rats were allocated randomly into six groups, including control, acetic acid, dexamethasone (2\u00a0mg/kg), and bupropion (40, 80, and 160\u00a0mg/kg). Colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of acetic acid in all study groups except control group, and animals were treated by oral administration of dexamethasone and bupropion. While macroscopic and microscopic lesions were observed after colitis induction, administration of dexamethasone and bupropion 160\u00a0mg/kg led to the remarkable improvement in lesions. In addition, the expression of TLR4 and NF-\u0138B was decreased after colitis induction; however, treatment with dexamethasone (2\u00a0mg/kg) and bupropion (160\u00a0mg/kg) resulted in a significant decrease in their expression.

        "Title": "Rodent Gut Bacteria Coexisting with an Insect Gut Virus in Parasitic Cysts: Metagenomic Evidence of Microbial Translocation and Co-adaptation in Spatially-Confined Niches.",
        "Abstract": "In medicine, parasitic cysts or cysticerci (fluid-filled cysts, larval stage of tapeworms) are believed to be sterile (no bacteria), and therein, the treatment of cysticerci infestations of deep extra-intestinal tissues (<i>e.g.</i>, brain) relies almost exclusively on the use of antiparasitic medications, and rarely antibiotics. To date, however, it is unclear why common post-treatment complications include abscessation. This study quantified the microbial composition of parasitic cyst contents in a higher-order rodent host, using multi-kingdom shotgun metagenomics, to improve our understanding of gut microbial translocation and adaptation strategies in wild environments. Analysis was conducted on DNA from two hepatic parasitic cysts (<i>Hydatigera (Taeenia) taeniaeformis</i>) in an adult vole mouse (<i>Microtus arvalis</i>), and from feces, liver, and peritoneal fluid of three other vole family members living in a vegetable garden in Ohio, USA. Bacterial metagenomics revealed the presence of gut commensal/opportunistic species, including <i>Parabacteroides distasonis, Klebsiella variicola, Enterococcus faecium</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>, inhabiting the cysts. <i>Parabacteroides distasonis</i> and other species were also present outside the cyst in the peritoneal fluid. Remarkably, viral metagenomics revealed various murine viral species, but unexpectedly, it detected an insect-origin virus from the army moth (<i>Pseudaletia/Mythimna unipuncta</i>) known as Mythimna unipuncta granulovirus A (MyunGV-A) in both cysts, and in one fecal and one peritoneal sample from two different voles, indicating survival of the insect virus and adaption in voles. Metagenomics also revealed a significantly lower probability of fungal detection in the cysts compared to other samples (peritoneal fluid, p<0.05; and feces p<0.05), with single taxon detection in each cyst for <i>Malassezia</i> and <i>Pseudophaeomoniella oleicola</i>. The samples with a higher probability of fungi were the peritoneal fluid. In conclusion, commensal/pathobiont bacterial species can inhabit parasitic tapeworm cysts, which needs to be considered during therapeutic decisions of cysticerci or other chronic disease scenarios where immune privileged and spatially restricted ecosystems with limited nutrients and minimal presence of immune cells could facilitate microbial adaptation, such as within gut wall cavitating micropathologies in Crohn's disease.",

Mutations in SKAP2 have been associated with several inflammatory disorders such as Type 1 Diabetes and Crohn's disease.

        "Title": "Generation and Characterization of Mirikizumab, a Humanized Monoclonal Antibody Targeting the p19 Subunit of IL-23.",
        "Abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-23 exists as a heterodimer consisting of p19 and p40 and is a key cytokine for promoting inflammatory responses in a variety of target organs. IL-23 plays a key role in the differentiation and maintenance of T helper 17 cells, and deregulation of IL-23 can result in autoimmune pathologies of the skin, lungs, and gut. This study describes the generation and characterization of mirikizumab (miri), a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody directed against the p19 subunit of IL-23. Miri binds human and cynomolgus monkey IL-23 with high affinity and binds rabbit IL-23 weakly but does not bind to rodent IL-23 or the other IL-23 family members IL-12, IL-27, or IL-35. Miri effectively inhibits the interaction of IL-23 with its receptor, and potently blocks IL-23-induced IL-17 production in cell-based assays while preserving the function of IL-12. In both local and systemic in vivo mouse models, miri blocked IL-23-induced keratin mRNA or IL-17 production, respectively. These data provide a comprehensive preclinical characterization of miri, for which efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in human clinical trials for psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This article describes the generation and characterization of mirikizumab, a high affinity, neutralizing IgG4 variant monoclonal antibody that is under development for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Neutralization of interleukin (IL)-23 is achieved by preventing the binding of IL-23 p19 subunit to the IL-23 receptor and does not affect the IL-12 pathway.",

IBD is associated with altered gut microbiota and their metabolites in the colon. Butyrate, a gut microbial metabolite, plays a crucial role in regulating immune function, epithelial barrier function, and intestinal homeostasis. In this review, we aim to present an overview of butyrate synthesis and metabolism and the mechanism of action of butyrate in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and to discuss the therapeutic implications of butyrate in IBD. <b>Methods:</b> We searched the literature up to March 2023 through PubMed, Web of Science, and other sources using search terms such as butyrate, inflammation, IBD, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Clinical studies in patients and preclinical studies in rodent models of IBD were included in the summary of the therapeutic implications of butyrate. <b>Results:</b> Research in the last two decades has shown the beneficial effects of butyrate on gut immune function and epithelial barrier function. Most of the preclinical and clinical studies have shown the positive effect of butyrate oral supplements in reducing inflammation and maintaining remission in colitis animal models and IBD patients. However, butyrate enema showed mixed effects. Butyrogenic diets, including germinated barley foodstuff and oat bran, are found to increase fecal butyrate concentrations and reduce the disease activity index in both animal models and IBD patients. <b>Conclusions:</b> The current literature suggests that butyrate is a potential add-on therapy to reduce inflammation and maintain IBD remission. Further clinical studies are needed to determine if butyrate administration alone is an effective therapeutic treatment for IBD.",

        "Title": "Bile acids as inflammatory mediators and modulators of intestinal permeability.",
        "Abstract": "Bile acids are critical for the digestion and absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins; however, evidence continues to emerge supporting additional roles for bile acids as signaling molecules. After they are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver, primary bile acids are modified into secondary bile acids by gut flora contributing to a diverse pool and making the composition of bile acids highly sensitive to alterations in gut microbiota. Disturbances in bile acid homeostasis have been observed in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). In fact, a decrease in secondary bile acids was shown to occur because of IBD-associated dysbiosis. Further, the increase in luminal bile acids due to malabsorption in Crohn's ileitis and ileal resection has been implicated in the induction of diarrhea and the exacerbation of inflammation. A causal link between bile acid signaling and intestinal inflammation has been recently suggested. With respect to potential mechanisms related to bile acids and IBD, several studies have provided strong evidence for direct effects of bile acids on intestinal permeability in porcine and rodent models as well as in humans. Interestingly, different bile acids were shown to exert distinct effects on the inflammatory response and intestinal permeability that require careful consideration. Such findings revealed a potential effect for changes in the relative abundance of different bile acids on the induction of inflammation by bile acids and the development of IBD. This review summarizes current knowledge about the roles for bile acids as inflammatory mediators and modulators of intestinal permeability mainly in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases.",

        "Title": "LRRK2 expression in normal and pathologic human gut and in rodent enteric neural cell lines.",
        "Abstract": "Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene, which is the gene most commonly associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), is also a susceptibility gene for Crohn's disease, thereby suggesting that LRRK2 may sit at the crossroads of gastrointestinal inflammation, Parkinson's, and Crohn's disease. LRRK2 protein has been studied intensely in both CNS neurons and in immune cells, but there are only few studies on LRRK2 in the enteric nervous system (ENS). LRRK2 is present in ENS ganglia and the existing studies on LRRK2 expression in colonic biopsies from PD subjects have yielded conflicting results. Herein, we propose to extend these findings by studying in more details LRRK2 expression in the ENS. LRRK2 expression was evaluated in full thickness segments of colon of 16 Lewy body, 12 non-Lewy body disorders cases, and 3 non-neurodegenerative controls and in various enteric neural cell lines. We showed that, in addition to enteric neurons, LRRK2 is constitutively expressed in enteric glial cells in both fetal and adult tissues. LRRK2 immunofluorescence intensity in the myenteric ganglia was not different between Lewy body and non-Lewy body disorders. Additionally, we identified the cAMP pathway as a key signaling pathway involved in the regulation of LRRK2 expression and phosphorylation in the enteric glial cells. Our study is the first detailed characterization of LRRK2 in the ENS and the first to show that enteric glial cells express LRRK2. Our findings provide a basis to unravel the functions of LRRK2 in the ENS and to further investigate the pathological changes in enteric synucleinopathies.",

        "Abstract": "Adrenomedullin is a bioactive peptide with many pleiotropic effects, including mucosal healing and immunomodulation. Adrenomedullin has shown beneficial effects in rodent models of inflammatory bowel disease and, more importantly, in clinical trials including patients with ulcerative colitis. We performed a successive clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of adrenomedullin in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). This was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2a trial that evaluated 24 patients with biologic-resistant CD in Japan. Patients were randomly assigned to three groups and were given an infusion of 10 or 15\u00a0ng/kg/min of adrenomedullin or placebo for 8\u00a0h per day for 7\u00a0days. The primary endpoint was the change in the CD activity index (CDAI) at 8\u00a0weeks. The main secondary endpoints included changes in CDAI from week 4 to week 24. No differences in the primary or secondary endpoints were observed between the three groups by the 8th week. Changes in CDAI in the placebo group gradually decreased and disappeared at 24\u00a0weeks, but those in the adrenomedullin-treated groups (10 or 15\u00a0ng/kg/min group) remained at steady levels for 24\u00a0weeks. Therefore, a significant difference was observed between the placebo and adrenomedullin-treated groups at 24\u00a0weeks (P\u00a0=\u00a00.043) in the mixed-effects model. We noted mild adverse events caused by the vasodilatory effect of adrenomedullin. In this trial, we observed a long-lasting (24\u00a0weeks) decrease in CDAI in the adrenomedullin-treated groups. Adrenomedullin might be beneficial for biologic-resistant CD, but further research is needed.",

        "Abstract": "ACE2, a carboxypeptidase that generates Ang-(1-7) from Ang II, is highly expressed in the lung, small intestine and colon. GPBAR1, is a G protein bile acid receptor that promotes the release of the insulinotropic factor glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and attenuates intestinal inflammation. We investigated the expression of ACE2, GLP-1 and GPBAR1 in two cohorts of Crohn's disease (CD) patients and three mouse models of colitis and Gpbar1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Activation of GPBAR1 in these models and in vitro was achieved by BAR501, a selective GPBAR1 agonist. In IBD patients, ACE2 mRNA expression was regulated in a site-specific manner in response to inflammation. While expression of ileal ACE2 mRNA was reduced, the colon expression was induced. Colon expression of ACE2 mRNA in IBD correlated with expression of TNF-\u03b1 and GPBAR1. A positive correlation occurred between GCG and GPBAR1 in human samples and animal models of colitis. In these models, ACE2 mRNA expression was further upregulated by GPABR1 agonism and reversed by exendin-3, a GLP-1 receptor antagonist. In in vitro studies, liraglutide, a GLP-1 analogue, increased the expression of ACE2 in colon epithelial cells/macrophages co-cultures. ACE2 mRNA expression in the colon of IBD patients and rodent models of colitis is regulated in a TNF-\u03b1- and GLP-1-dependent manner. We have identified a GPBAR1/GLP-1 mechanism as a positive modulator of ACE2.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract affecting approximately 20 per 1,00,000 in Europe and USA. CD is characterized by transmural inflammation, intestinal fibrosis, and luminal stenosis. Although anti-inflammatory therapies may help control inflammation, they have no efficacy on fibrosis and stenosis in CD. The pathogenesis of CD is not well understood. Current studies focus mainly on delineating dysregulated gut immune response mechanisms. While CD-associated transmural inflammation, intestinal fibrosis, and luminal stenosis all represent mechanical stress to the gut wall, the role of mechanical stress in CD is not well defined. To determine if mechanical stress plays an independent pathogenic role in CD, a protocol of TNBS-induced CD-like colitis model in rodents has been developed. This TNBS-induced transmural inflammation and fibrosis model resembles pathological hallmarks of CD in the colon. It is induced by intracolonic instillation of TNBS into the distal colon of adult Sprague-Dawley rats. In this model, transmural inflammation leads to stenosis at the TNBS instillation site (Site I). Mechanical distention is observed in the portion proximal to the instillation site (Site P), representing mechanical stress but not visible inflammation. Colonic portion distal to inflammation (Site D) presents neither inflammation nor mechanical stress. Distinctive changes of gene expression, immune response, fibrosis, and smooth muscle growth at different sites (P, I, and D) were observed, highlighting a profound impact of mechanical stress. Therefore, this model of CD-like colitis will help us better understand CD's pathogenic mechanisms, particularly the role of mechanical stress and mechanical stress-induced gene expression in immune dysregulation, intestinal fibrosis, and tissue remodeling in CD.",

        "Title": "Low dietary fiber promotes enteric expansion of a Crohn's disease-associated pathobiont independent of obesity.",
        "Abstract": "Obesity is associated with metabolic, immunological, and infectious disease comorbidities, including an increased risk of enteric infection and inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease (CD). Expansion of intestinal pathobionts such as adherent-invasive <i>Escherichia coli</i> (AIEC) is a common dysbiotic feature of CD, which is amplified by prior use of oral antibiotics. Although high-fat, high-sugar diets are associated with dysbiotic expansion of <i>E. coli</i>, it is unknown if the content of fat or another dietary component in obesogenic diets is sufficient to promote AIEC expansion. Here, we found that administration of an antibiotic combined with feeding mice an obesogenic low-fiber, high-sucrose, high-fat diet (HFD) that is typically used in rodent-obesity studies promoted AIEC intestinal expansion. Even a short-term (i.e., 1 day) pulse of HFD feeding before infection was sufficient to promote AIEC expansion, indicating that the magnitude of obesity was not the main driver of AIEC expansion. Controlled-diet experiments demonstrated that neither dietary fat nor sugar were the key determinants of AIEC colonization, but that lowering dietary fiber from approximately 13% to 5%-6% was sufficient to promote the intestinal expansion of AIEC when combined with antibiotics in mice. When combined with antibiotics, lowering fiber promoted AIEC intestinal expansion to a similar extent as widely used HFDs in mice. However, lowering dietary fiber was sufficient to promote AIEC intestinal expansion without affecting body mass. Our results show that low dietary fiber combined with oral antibiotics are environmental factors that promote the expansion of Crohn's disease-associated pathobionts in the gut.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> It is commonly thought that obesity or a high-fat diet alters pathogenic bacteria and promotes inflammatory gut diseases. We found that lower dietary fiber is a key factor that expands a gut pathobiont linked to Crohn's disease, independent of obesity status in mice.",

In the majority of hosts, these symbionts contribute largely to beneficial functions promoting microbe-host homeostasis. However, an increasing number of human diseases is associated with altered microbiota composition and enrichment of certain bacterial species. A well-known example of this is Mucispirillum schaedleri, which has been associated with inflammatory conditions in the intestine. Mucispirillum spp. belong to the phylum Deferribacteres and are prevalent but low abundant members of the rodent, pig and human microbiota. Recently, M. schaedleri was causally linked to the development of Crohn's disease-like colitis in immunodeficient mice. While this study certifies a considerable pathogenic potential, the same organism can also promote health in the immunocompetent host: M. schaedleri protects from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.

        "Abstract": "With the epidemic of human obesity, dietary fats have increasingly become a focal point of biomedical research. Epidemiological studies indicate that high-fat diets (HFDs), especially those rich in long-chain saturated fatty acids (e.g., Western Diet, National Health Examination survey; NHANES 'What We Eat in America' report) have multi-organ pro-inflammatory effects. Experimental studies have confirmed some of these disease associations, and have begun to elaborate mechanisms of disease induction. However, many of the observed effects from epidemiological studies appear to be an over-simplification of the mechanistic complexity that depends on dynamic interactions between the host, the particular fatty acid, and the rather personalized genetics and variability of the gut microbiota. Of interest, experimental studies have shown that certain saturated fats (e.g., lauric and myristic fatty acid-rich coconut oil) could exert the opposite effect; that is, desirable anti-inflammatory and protective mechanisms promoting gut health by unanticipated pathways. Owing to the experimental advantages of laboratory animals for the study of mechanisms under well-controlled dietary settings, we focus this review on the current understanding of how dietary fatty acids impact intestinal biology. We center this discussion on studies from mice and rats, with validation in cell culture systems or human studies. We provide a scoping overview of the most studied diseases mechanisms associated with the induction or prevention of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in rodent models relevant to Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis after feeding either high-fat diet (HFD) or feed containing specific fatty acid or other target dietary molecule. Finally, we provide a general outlook on areas that have been largely or scarcely studied, and assess the effects of HFDs on acute and chronic forms of intestinal inflammation.",

We compared 5 rodent diets designed to mirror the 2011-2012 \"What We Eat in America\" NHANES. Each diet had 1 macronutrient dietary source replaced. The formulated diets were AD, AD-soy-pea (animal protein replaced by soy\u00a0+\u00a0pea protein), AD-CHO (\"refined carbohydrate\" by polysaccharides), AD-fat [redistribution of the \u03c9-6:\u03c9-3 (n-6:n-3) PUFA ratio; \u223c10:1 to 1:1], and AD-mix (all 3 \"healthier\" macronutrients combined). In 3 separate experiments, 8-wk-old germ-free SAMP1/YitFC mice (SAMP) colonized with human gut microbiota (\"hGF-SAMP\") from CD or healthy donors were fed an AD, an AD-\"modified,\" or laboratory rodent diet for 24 wk. Two subsequent dextran sodium sulfate-colitis experiments in hGF-SAMP (12-wk-old) and specific-pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6 (20-wk-old) mice, and a 6-wk feeding trial in 24-wk-old SPF SAMP were performed. Intestinal inflammation, gut metagenomics, and MS profiles were assessed. The AD-soy-pea diet resulted in lower histology scores [mean \u00b1 SD (56.1%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020.7% reduction)] in all feeding trials and IBD mouse models than did other diets (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

An inflammasome pathway was evaluated in the gut and peripheral blood from 40 AS patients using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy, and was compared to that of 20 healthy controls and 10 patients with Crohn's disease. Bacteria was visualized using silver stain in human samples, and antibiotics were administered to HLA-B27-transgenic rats. The NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 was administered to SKG mice, and ileal and joint tissues were assessed by IHC analysis and real-time qRT-PCR. The role of inflammasome in modulating the interleukin-23 (IL-23)/IL-17 axis was studied ex vivo. Expression levels of Nlrp3, Nlrc4, and Aim2 were increased in the gut of HLA-B27-transgenic rats and reduced by antibiotic treatment (P < 0.05). In curdlan-treated SKG mice, NLRP3 blockade prevented ileitis and delayed arthritis onset (P < 0.05). Compared to healthy controls, AS patients demonstrated overexpression of NLRP3 (fold induction 2.33 versus 22.2; P < 0.001), NLRC4 (fold induction 1.90 versus 6.47; P < 0.001), AIM2 (fold induction 2.40 versus 20.8; P < 0.001), CASP1 (fold induction 2.53 versus 24.8; P < 0.001), IL1B (fold induction 1.07 versus 10.93; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and IL18 (fold induction 2.56 versus 15.67; P < 0.001) in the ileum, and caspase 1 activity was increased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

Induction of IL23A, IL17A, and IL22 was IL-1\u03b2-dependent. Inflammasome activation occurs in rodent models of AS and in AS patients, is associated with dysbiosis, and is involved in triggering ileitis in SKG mice.

Our aim was to determine whether and how dysregulated thrombin activity could contribute to local tissue malfunctions associated with Crohn's disease. Thrombin activity was studied in tissues from Crohn's disease patients and healthy controls. Intracolonic administration of thrombin to wild-type or protease-activated receptor-deficient mice was used to assess the effects and mechanisms of local thrombin upregulation. Colitis was induced in rats and mice by the intracolonic administration of trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid. Active forms of thrombin were increased in Crohn's disease patient tissues. Elevated thrombin expression and activity were associated with intestinal epithelial cells. Increased thrombin activity and expression were also a feature of experimental colitis in rats. Colonic exposure to doses of active thrombin comparable to what is found in inflammatory bowel disease tissues caused mucosal damage and tissue dysfunctions in mice, through a mechanism involving both protease-activated receptors -1 and -4. Intracolonic administration of the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, as well as inhibition of protease-activated receptor-1, prevented trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid-induced colitis in rodent models. Our data demonstrated that increased local thrombin activity, as it occurs in the colon of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, causes mucosal damage and inflammation. Colonic thrombin and protease-activated receptor-1 appear as possible mechanisms involved in mucosal damage and loss of function and therefore represent potential therapeutic targets for treating inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases, mainly ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are characterized by chronic inflammation in the intestine. Currently several therapeutic strategies available to treat inflammatory bowel diseases. Though, most treatments can be associated with serious adverse effects what justifies the search for new treatments. In this sense, we highlight the interest in herbal products rich in bioactive compounds which immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties as is the case of <i>Bryophyllum pinnatum</i> (Crassulaceae). This plant is used in traditional medicine in Brazil for treating inflammatory diseases. We hypothesized that hydroethanolic <i>B. pinnatum</i> leaf extract has intestinal anti-inflammatory effects on two experimental colitis models: 2.4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS) in rats, and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice. Ultra-fast liquid chromatography method used for the quantification of the main compounds indicated good linearity, specificity, selectivity, precision, robustness and accuracy. The major flavonoids (mg/g of the extract) quantified were: quercetin 3-<i>O</i>-\u03b1-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1\u21922)-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranoside (35.56 \u00b1 0.086 mg/g), kaempferol 3-<i>O</i>-\u03b1-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1\u21922)-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranoside (4.66 \u00b1 0.076 mg/g) and quercetin-3-<i>O</i>-rhamnopyranoside (4.56 \u00b1 0.026 mg/g). The results obtained in the DNBS and DSS models indicate that extract has both chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory effects, observing a significant reduction in the disease activity index score, and less macroscopic and microscopic damage. The extract promoted downregulation of Toll-like receptor and <i>kappa</i> B p65 nuclear factor gene expression, leading to a reduction in pro-inflammatory and oxidative mediators, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules. This immunomodulatory property was proposed that one of the possible action mechanisms of extract. An improvement in intestinal damage was also associated with a reduction in oxidative stress and infiltration of leukocytes, as evidenced by the reduction in malonaldialdehyde and myeloperoxidase activity and increase in total glutathione in the colonic tissue. Moreover, the extract improved the cytoarchitecture of the colonic tissue and the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier by restoring the expression of the proteins associated with mucosa protection. In view of the beneficial effects showed by the <i>B. pinnatum</i> leaf extract in preclinical rodent models of colitis there is the potential to conduct some future clinical studies to ensure safe and effective development of a phytotherapeutic treatment for human inflammatory bowel diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) hold great promise in the field of regenerative medicine due to their ability to create a variable localized anti-inflammatory effect in injuries such as Crohn's disease and osteoarthritis or by incorporation in tissue engineered constructs. Currently, the MSC literature uses rodents for preclinical disease models. There is growing interest in using naturally occurring disease in large animals for modeling human disease. By review of the canine MSCs literature, it appears that canine MSCs can be difficult to maintain in culture for extended passages and this greatly varies between tissue sources, compared with human and rodent MSCs, and limited lifespan is an obstacle for preclinical investigation and therapeutic use. Research using canine MSCs has been focused on cells derived from bone marrow or adipose tissue, and the differences in manufacturing MSCs between laboratories are problematic due to lack of standardization. To address these issues, here, a stepwise process was used to optimize canine MSCs isolation, expansion, and cryopreservation utilizing canine umbilical cord-derived MSCs. The culture protocol utilizes coating of tissue culture surfaces that increases cellular adherence, increases colony-forming units-fibroblast efficiency, and decreases population doubling times. Canine MSCs isolated with our protocol could be maintained longer than published canine MSCs methods before senescing. Our improved cryopreservation protocols produce on average >90% viable MSCs at thaw. These methods enable master-bank and working-bank scenarios for allogeneic MSC testing in naturally occurring disease in dogs.",

Here, we performed an exploratory analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from healthy controls and drug-na\u00efve patients with early MS using multiplexed single-cell mass cytometry and algorithm-based data analysis. Two antibody panels comprising a total of 64 antibodies were designed to comprehensively analyse diverse immune cell populations, with particular emphasis on monocytes.

However, an increased abundance of CCR7<sup>+</sup> and IL-6<sup>+</sup> T cells was detected in early MS-PBMCs, whereas NFAT1<sup>hi</sup>T-bet<sup>hi</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were decreased. Similarly, we detected changes in the subset composition of the CCR7<sup>+</sup> and MIP\u03b2<sup>hi</sup> HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte compartment. Only mild alterations were detected in monocytes/myeloid cells of patients with early MS, namely a decreased abundance of CD141<sup>hi</sup>IRF8<sup>hi</sup>CXCR3<sup>+</sup>CD68<sup>-</sup> dendritic cells. Unlike in Crohn's disease, no significant differences were found in the monocyte fraction of patients with early MS compared to healthy controls.

The ramifications for this on future health care costs and longevity are consequent, whilst increased adiposity is a harbinger for diabetes, kidney and bone failure, and cancer. An area of intense interest where the role of adiposity is avidly discussed is in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which presents mainly as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Studies in patients associating IBD with a western diet are divergent. Nevertheless, elegant studies have found gene polymorphisms in humans that in murine models parallel the inflammatory and gut microbiome changes seen in IBD patients. However, an area not to be ignored are the alterations in adipocyte function with ensuing adiposity, in particular and a focus of this review, the dysregulation of the levels of adipocytokines such as leptin and adiponectin. Herein, we present and discuss the known influences of a western diet on IBD in patients and rodent models and how adipocytokines could influence the IBD disease process.",

        "Abstract": "Alterations in the gut microbiota are strongly associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly with Crohn's disease, which is characterized by reduced abundance of commensal anaerobic bacteria including members of the Bacteroides genus. Our aim was to investigate the protective effects of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, an abundant member of this genus, in different rodent models of IBD. We assessed the effect of B. thetaiotaomicron administration on primary readouts of colitis (weight loss, histopathology, and immune parameters) in dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) and interleukin-10 knockout (IL10KO) models of IBD. Efficacy of a freeze-dried bacterial formulation and a purified recombinant protein of B. thetaiotaomicron was also investigated. B. thetaiotaomicron showed protective effects in both DSS and IL10KO rodent models, as demonstrated by significant amelioration of weight loss, colon shortening, histopathological damage and immune activation. This efficacy was not exclusive to actively growing bacterial preparations but was retained by freeze-dried cells of B. thetaiotaomicron. A pirin-like protein (PLP) of B. thetaiotaomicron, identified by microarray analysis during coculture of the bacterial strain with Caco-2 cells, reduced pro-inflammatory NF-\u03baB signalling in these intestinal epithelial cells. Recombinant PLP partially recapitulated the effect of the whole strain in a rat DSS model. B. thetaiotaomicron displays strong efficacy in preclinical models of IBD and protects against weight loss, histopathological changes in the colon and inflammatory markers. These data indicate that the live strain or its products may be a novel alternative to current treatment options for Crohn's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease with gastrointestinal dysfunction as well as comorbidities such as inflammation-induced bone loss and impaired immune response. Current treatments for IBD all have negative, potentially severe side effects. We aimed to test whether exogenous treatment with irisin, a novel immunomodulatory adipomyokine, could ameliorate IBD-induced lymphatic and bone alterations. Irisin treatment improved both gut and bone outcomes by mitigating inflammation and restoring structure. In the gut, IBD caused colonic lymphatic hyperproliferation into the mucosal and submucosal compartments. This proliferation in the rodent model is akin to what is observed in IBD patient case studies. In bone, IBD increased osteoclast surface and decreased bone formation. Both gut and osteocytes in bone exhibited elevated levels of TNF-\u03b1 and receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) protein expression. Exogenous irisin treatment restored normal colonic lymphatic architecture and increased bone formation rate concurrent with decreased osteoclast surfaces. After irisin treatment, gut and osteocyte TNF-\u03b1 and RANKL protein expression levels were no different from vehicle controls. Our data indicate that the systemic immunologic changes that occur in IBD are initiated by damage in the gut and likely linked through the lymphatic system. Additionally, irisin is a potential novel intervention mitigating both local inflammatory changes in the gut and distant changes in bone.-Narayanan, S. A., Metzger, C. E., Bloomfield, S. A., Zawieja, D. C. Inflammation-induced lymphatic architecture and bone turnover changes are ameliorated by irisin treatment in chronic inflammatory bowel disease.",

Immunomodulators and biological agents can help but cause severe side effects in long-term use. As such, complementary and alternative medicine, in particular herbal remedy, is becoming more and more popular in the treatment of IBD patients. Many natural compounds have been used in clinical trials and some have been proven promising in IBD treatment. To achieve a better understanding of herbal therapy, researchers focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms by using experimental rodent models. The mechanism of the pathogenesis of IBD is complex involving both environmental and genetic factors. IBD is considered as a consequence of impaired epithelial barrier function, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and aberrant immune response. Studies have demonstrated that herbal medicine can improve epithelial proliferation and barrier integrity, restore microbiota homeostasis, and suppress hyper-immune reaction. This review is to summarize current understanding of the molecular basis of herbal treatment of IBD at the levels of epithelial, microbial, and immune regulation.",

        "Abstract": "Fatigue is a highly prevalent but relatively ignored problem in IBD patients. It is one of the most burdensome symptoms to the patient with an important impact on the quality of life. Therefore, fatigue is a highly relevant patient-reported outcome that should be included not only in disease activity measurement but also in the endpoints of clinical trials in IBD. However, most of the currently available scoring systems to quantify fatigue are not specifically designed for patients with IBD and none of them has undergone a complete validation process for IBD-related fatigue. Fatigue is more prevalent in patients with active disease and may improve or disappear when remission is reached. Far more complex is the persistence or onset of fatigue in quiescent IBD which presents in up to 40% of the patients. In this subgroup of patients, fatigue can be related to smoldering systemic inflammation, a poor sleep quality, anemia, nutritional deficiencies, or comorbidities. In most cases, however, no direct cause can be identified. The lack of knowledge on the mechanisms that drive fatigue in IBD hamper the development of specific drugs to treat the condition and only psychological support can be offered to the patient. Rodent models are indispensable to increase our understanding of the molecular pathways that lead to fatigue in chronic intestinal inflammation, and to develop novel therapies.",

        "Abstract": "The pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), involves aberrant interactions between a genetically susceptible individual, their microbiota and environmental factors. Alterations in xenobiotic receptor expression and function are associated with increased risk for IBD. Here, we have assessed the role of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a xenobiotic receptor closely related to the pregnane X receptor, in the regulation of intestinal mucosal homeostasis. CAR expression was assessed in intestinal mucosal biopsies obtained from CD and UC patients, and in C57/Bl6 mice exposed to dextran sulphate sodium (DSS; 3.5% w/v in drinking water) to evoke intestinal inflammation and tissue damage. CAR-deficient mice were exposed to DSS and mucosal healing assessed. Modulation of wound healing by CAR was assessed in vitro. The therapeutic potential of CAR activation was evaluated, using 3,3',5,5'-tetrachloro-1,4-bis(pyridyloxy)benzene (TCPOBOP), a selective rodent CAR agonist. CAR expression was reduced in CD and UC samples, compared with expression in healthy controls. This was reproduced in our DSS studies, where CAR expression was reduced in colitic mice. CAR-deficient mice exhibited reduced healing following DSS exposure. In vitro, CAR activation accelerated intestinal epithelial wound healing by enhancing cell migration. Lastly, treating mice with TCPOBOP, following induction of colitis, enhanced mucosal healing. Our results support the notion that xenobiotic sensing is altered during intestinal inflammation, and suggest that CAR activation may prove effective in enhancing mucosal healing in patients with IBD.",

This raised the need of novel standards to adequately address quality, efficacy and safety issues of this advanced therapy. The development of a streamlined regulation is currently hampered by the complexity of analyzing dynamic biological entities rather than chemicals. Although numerous pieces of evidence show efficacy in reducing intestinal inflammation, some inconsistencies between the mechanisms of action of rodent <i>vs</i> human MSCs suggest caution before assigning translational value to preclinical studies. Preliminary evidence from clinical trials showed efficacy of MSCs in the treatment of fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD), and preparations of heterologous MSCs for CD treatment are currently tested in ongoing clinical trials. However, safety issues, especially in long-term treatment, still require solid clinical data. In this regard, standardized guidelines for appropriate dosing and methods of infusion could enhance the likelihood to predict more accurately the number of responders and the duration of remission periods. In addition, elucidating MSC mechanisms of action could lead to novel and more reliable formulations such as those derived from the MSCs themselves (<i>e.g</i>., supernatants).",

This lack of response may be related to differences in patients' gut microbiomes prior to and after disease initiation or treatment. Recent observations in our lab using a rodent model of IBD support the theory that TNF drives acute colitis, but also that the microbiome differs in association with TNF production and colitis severity.

Full characterization of Th17 cells in dogs has not been completed. We have developed and validated a flow-cytometric method to detect Th17 cells in canine blood. We further demonstrate that Th17 and other IL17 producing cells are present in tissues of dogs with naturally occurring chronic inflammatory diseases. Finally, we have determined the kinetics of a canine specific Th17 polarization in vitro and demonstrate that canine MSC inhibit Th17 polarization in vitro, in a PGE2 independent mechanism. Our findings provide fundamental research tools and suggest that naturally occurring diseases in dogs, such as inflammatory bowel disease, may be harnessed to translate novel MSC based therapeutic strategies that target the Th17 pathway.",

After treatment for 6 months, when a definite diagnosis was reached, the differential diagnostic value of each parameter was analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze further, parameters of statistical significance to establish a mathematical regression equation. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted. Clinical parameters helpful in differentiating CD from ITB included diarrhea, night sweat and perianal disease. Endoscopic parameters were useful in differentiating CD from ITB including transverse ulcers, longitudinal ulcers, rodent-like ulcers and patulous ileocecal valve. CT enterographic parameters aided the identification of the two conditions. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of a mathematical regression model established for 6 parameters of clinical endoscopy and CT enterography were 97.8%, 96.8%, 97.6%, 98.9% and 93.7% respectively, whereas those for T-SPOT were 96.8%, 91.3%, 92.7%, 78.9% and 98.8% respectively.

However, complex therapeutic molecules cannot easily be delivered through the GI tract because of physiologic and structural barriers. We report the use of ultrasound as a modality for enhanced drug delivery to the GI tract, with an emphasis on rectal delivery. Ultrasound increased the absorption of model therapeutics inulin, hydrocortisone, and mesalamine two- to tenfold in ex vivo tissue, depending on location in the GI tract. In pigs, ultrasound induced transient cavitation with negligible heating, leading to an order of magnitude enhancement in the delivery of mesalamine, as well as successful systemic delivery of a macromolecule, insulin, with the expected hypoglycemic response. In a rodent model of chemically induced acute colitis, the addition of ultrasound to a daily mesalamine enema (compared to enema alone) resulted in superior clinical and histological scores of disease activity. In both animal models, ultrasound treatment was well tolerated and resulted in minimal tissue disruption, and in mice, there was no significant effect on histology, fecal score, or tissue inflammatory cytokine levels. The use of ultrasound to enhance GI drug delivery is safe in animals and could augment the efficacy of GI therapies and broaden the scope of agents that could be delivered locally and systemically through the GI tract for chronic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two major forms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), are characterized by high levels of IL-22 production. Rodent studies revealed that this cytokine is protective during colitis but whether this is true in IBDs is unclear. We show here that levels of the soluble inhibitor of IL-22, interleukin 22-binding protein (IL-22BP), are significantly enhanced during IBDs owing to increased numbers of IL-22BP-producing eosinophils, that we unexpectedly identify as the most abundant source of IL-22BP protein in human gut. In addition, using IL-22BP-deficient rats, we confirm that endogenous IL-22BP is effective at blocking protective actions of IL-22 during acute colitis. In conclusion, our study provides new important insights regarding the biology of IL-22 and IL-22BP in the gut and indicates that protective actions of IL-22 are likely to be suboptimal in IBDs thus making IL-22BP a new relevant therapeutic target.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a multifactorial disorder with many different putative influences mediating disease onset, severity, progression and diminution. Spontaneous natural IBD is classically expressed as Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) commonly found in primates; lymphoplasmocytic enteritis, eosinophilic gastritis and colitis, and ulcerative colitis with neuronal hyperplasia in dogs; and colitis in horses. Spontaneous inflammatory bowel disease has been noted in a number of rodent models which differ in genetic strain background, induced mutation, microbiota influences and immunopathogenic pathways. Histological lesions in Crohn's Disease feature noncaseating granulomatous inflammation while UC lesions typically exhibit ulceration, lamina propria inflammatory infiltrates and lack of granuloma development. Intestinal inflammation caused by CD and UC is also associated with increased incidence of intestinal neoplasia. Transgenic murine models have determined underlying etiological influences and appropriate therapeutic targets in IBD. This literature review will discuss current opinion and findings in spontaneous IBD, highlight selected transgenic rodent models of IBD and discuss their respective pathogenic mechanisms. It is very important to provide accommodation of induced putative deficits in activities of daily living and to assess discomfort and pain levels in the face of significant morbidity and/or mortality in these models. Epigenetic, environmental (microbiome, metabolome) and nutritional factors are important in IBD pathogenesis, and evaluating ways in which they influence disease expression represent potential investigative approaches with the greatest potential for new discoveries.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis presently have no cure and are treated with anti-inflammatory drugs or monoclonal antibodies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines. A variety of rodent models have been used to model chronic and acute colitis. Dietary polyphenols in foods and botanicals are of considerable interest for prevention and treatment of colitis. Many dietary polyphenols have been utilized for prevention of colitis in rodent models. Berries, green tea polyphenols, curcumin, and stilbenes have been the most extensively tested polyphenols in rodent models of colitis. The majority of polyphenols tested have inhibited colitis in rodents, but increasing doses of EGCG and green tea, isoflavones, flaxseed, and \u03b1-mangostin have exacerbated colitis. Few studies have examined combination of polyphenols or other bioactives for inhibition of colitis. Translating polyphenol doses used in rodent models of colitis to human equivalent doses reveals that supplemental doses are most likely required to inhibit colitis from a single polyphenol treatment. The ability to translate polyphenol treatments in rodent models is likely to be limited by species differences in xenobiotic metabolism and microbiota. Given these limitations, data from polyphenols in rodent models suggests merit for pursuing additional clinical studies for prevention of colitis.",

        "Abstract": "An increasing body of evidence has linked diet to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Most of our current knowledge pertains to the link between diet and Crohn's disease. Exclusive enteral nutrition and partial enteral nutrition are the best known dietary intervention for the induction of remission and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease both in children and in adults, but the mechanism whereby these interventions may cause or maintain remission and mucosal healing has remained elusive. Recent studies have shed light on the possible mechanisms of response to dietary intervention. Epidemiological and rodent model studies over the last year have supplied us with several dietary candidates for an effect of diet on inflammation and disease pathogenesis. Others have shed insight into the effect of diet on dysbiosis and the microbiota. An elimination diet based on some of these candidates has shown clinical efficacy, and bridged the knowledge obtained from rodent models to a human intervention. These studies may allow better understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD and provide new tools to treat these difficult diseases. Elimination diets based on the identification of deleterious dietary components may pave the way for an improved control of the disease in the future. http://links.lww.com/COG/A10.",

Current in vitro models of intestinal fibrosis cannot model the complex intestinal architecture, while in vivo rodent models do not fully recapitulate human disease and have limited utility for large-scale screening. Here, we exploit recent advances in stem cell derived human intestinal organoids (HIOs) as a new human model of fibrosis in CD. Human pluripotent stem cells were differentiated into HIOs. We identified myofibroblasts, the key effector cells of fibrosis, by immunofluorescence staining for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), vimentin, and desmin. We examined the fibrogenic response of HIOs by treatment with transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) in the presence or absence of the anti-fibrotic drug spironolactone. Fibrotic response was assayed by expression of fibrogenic genes (COL1A1 (collagen, type I, alpha 1), ACTA2 (alpha smooth muscle actin), FN1 (fibronectin 1), MYLK (myosin light chain kinase), and MKL1 (megakaryoblastic leukemia (translocation) 1)) and proteins (\u03b1SMA). Immunofluorescent staining of organoids identified a population of myofibroblasts within the HIO mesenchyme. TGF\u03b2 stimulation of HIOs produced a dose-dependent pro-fibrotic response. Spironolactone treatment blocked the fibrogenic response of HIOs to TGF\u03b2. HIOs contain myofibroblasts and respond to a pro-fibrotic stimulus in a manner that is consistent with isolated human myofibroblasts. HIOs are a promising model system that might bridge the gap between current in vitro and in vivo models of intestinal fibrosis in IBD.",

As a suitable rabbit IBD model is currently not available, we developed a rabbit colitis model by administration of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). White Himalayan rabbits (n\u00a0=\u00a012) received 0.1% DSS in the daily water supply for five days. Clinical symptoms were monitored daily, and rabbits were sacrificed at different time points. A genomewide expression analysis was performed with RNA isolated from caecal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). The disease activity index of DSS rabbits increased up to 2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 (n\u00a0=\u00a06) at day 10 (controls <0.5). DSS induced a caecum-localized pathology with crypt architectural distortion, stunted villous surface and inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria. The histopathology score reached a peak of 14.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9 (n\u00a0=\u00a04) at day 10 (controls 7.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9, n\u00a0=\u00a05). Expression profiling revealed an enrichment of IBD-related genes in both LPMC and IEC. Innate inflammatory response, Th17 signalling and chemotaxis were among the pathways affected significantly. We describe a reproducible and reliable rabbit model of DSS colitis. Localization of the inflammation in the caecum and its similarities to IBD make this model particularly suitable to study TSO therapy in vivo.",

        "Title": "Development, validation and implementation of an in vitro model for the study of metabolic and immune function in normal and inflamed human colonic epithelium.",
        "Abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic immune disorders affecting the gastrointestinal tract. The aetiology of IBD remains an enigma, but increasing evidence suggests that the development of IBD may be triggered by a disturbance in the balance between gut commensal bacteria and host response in the intestinal mucosa. It is now known that epithelial cells have the capacity to secrete and respond to a range of immunological mediators and this suggests that these cells play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Current knowledge about the intestinal epithelium has mainly been obtained using models based on animal cells, transformed human intestinal cell lines and isolated cells from resected colonic bowel segments. Species difference, malignant origin and confounders related to surgery, obviously make these cell models however less applicable for patophysiological studies. Consequently, there was a clear need for models of representative intestinal epithelial cells that would allow functional and dynamic studies of the differentiated human colonic epithelium in vitro. The primary purpose of this thesis was to explore and validate the optimal conditions for establishing a model based on short-term cultures of human colonic epithelial cells obtained from endoscopical biopsies. The cell cultures were accordingly used to describe the interplay between proinflammatory cytokines and colonic epithelium, with focus on alterations in viability, butyrate metabolism and secretion of a chemokine and metalloproteinases (MMP). Finally, the model was used to characterize expression and activation of receptors like toll like receptor (TLR)9 and peroxisome activated proliferators (PPAR)- known to be important players in regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses in human colonic epithelium. The results showed that it is possible to establish short-term cultures of representative, viable human colonic epithelial cells from endoscopic mucosal biopsies of patients with IBD. Short-time isolation by EGTA/EDTA from colonic biopsies allowed establishment of small scale cultures of epithelial cells which were viable and metabolic active for up to 48 hours in vitro. The cell model preserved important cellular metabolic and immunological functions of the human colonic epithelium, including the ability to oxidate butyrate, detoxificate phenolic compounds and secrete the chemokine interleukin (IL)-8 in vitro. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 are pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are present in increased amounts in inflamed colonic mucosa. The precise mechanisms of cytokine-mediated mucosal injury are unknown, but one might be that TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 directly impair epithelial cell function similar to effects seen on distinct target cells in other autoimmune diseases. Using the model, both cytokines were found directly to impair the viability of colonic epithelial cells and to induce secretion of IL-8 in vitro. Interestingly, the cells from inflamed IBD mucosa were less sensitive to cytokine-induced damage, which suggests that an intrinsic defense mechanism is triggered in these cells, perhaps as a result of exposure to toxic luminal factors or high local cytokine levels in vivo. TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 may also be involved in regulation of intestinal inflammation through stimulation of MMP expression and proteolytic activity. We found that colonic epithelial cells express a range of MMPs and moreover that expression of distinct MMPs is increased in cells from inflamed IBD mucosa. Using a functional peptide cleavage assay it was shown that epithelial cells secreted proteolytic active enzymes and that the functional MMP activity was increased in inflamed IBD mucosa. This suggests that colonic epithelial cells, like myofibroblasts and immune cells, may contribute to local intestinal mucosal damage, through secretion of active MMPs. Disturbance of recognition and discrimination of potentially harmful pathogens from commensals in the intestinal mucosa have increasingly been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. Our results revealed that colonic epithelial cells express TLR9, a key pattern recognition receptor. Interestingly, the differentiated epithelial cells, which have been exposed to the luminal bacterial flora in vivo, were unresponsive to TLR9 ligand stimulation, contrasting findings in the epithelial cell line HT-29 that is cultured continuously in bacteria free environment. These findings suggest, theoretically, that colonic epithelium may regulate immune responses to microbial antigens including commensal bacterial DNA through modulation of the TLR9 pathway. Currently, the results are in line with the emerging view, that the epithelium represents an important frontline cellular component of the innate immune system in the gut. PPAR\u03b3 is a nuclear receptor involved in the regulation of lipid and carbonhydrate metabolism. Recent studies in rodent colitis models suggest that PPAR\u03b3 also is involved in modulation of inflammatory processes in the colon. Using the model, we characterise expression and activity of PPARs in human colonic epithelium and, additionally, evaluated the functional significance of a possible imbalanced PPAR\u03b3 regulation in relation to inflammation. Our experiments showed that colonic epithelial cells express PPAR\u03b3 and furthermore that PPAR\u03b3 signalling was impaired in inflamed UC epithelium. It was possible to restore PPAR\u03b3 signalling in the cell cultures by stimulation with rosiglitazone (a synthetic PPAR\u03b3 ligand) in vitro. Hence, these experiments prompted us to design a small controlled, clinical study exploring the possible stimulatory effects of rosiglitazone (a PPAR ligand) in vivo. Interestingly, it was found that topical application of rosiglitazone in patients with active distal UC reduced clinical activity and mucosal inflammation similar to the effects measured in patients treated with mesalazine enemas. Moreover, rectal application of rosiglitazone induced PPAR\u03b3 signalling in the epithelium in vivo, supporting the view that activation of PPAR\u03b3 may be a new potential therapeutic target in the treatment of UC. Overall, the in vitro model of representative human colonic epithelial cells has shown to be a useful technique for detailed studies of metabolic and immunological functions that are important for homeostasis of the colonic epithelium. Currently, the findings support the view that intestinal epithelial cells actively participate in immunological processes in the colonic mucosa. Additionally, the model seems to be applicable for generating and evaluating new therapeutic approaches from laboratory bench to bed line as illustrated by the PPAR\u03b3 study. It is therefore probable, that studies in models of representative colonic epithelial cells, as the one described here, could contribute with important knowledge about the pathogenesis of human inflammatory colonic diseases also in the future.",

        "Abstract": "The intestinal epithelial barrier plays a key role in the maintenance of homeostasis within the gastrointestinal tract. Barrier dysfunction leading to increased epithelial permeability is associated with a number of gastrointestinal disorders including the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. It is thought that the increased permeability in patients with IBD may be driven by alterations in the epithelial wound healing response. To this end considerable study has been undertaken to identify signaling pathways that may accelerate intestinal epithelial wound healing and normalize the barrier dysfunction observed in IBD. In the current study we examined the role of the pregnane X receptor (PXR) in modulating the intestinal epithelial wound healing response. Mutations and reduced mucosal expression of the PXR are associated with IBD, and others have reported that PXR agonists can dampen intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, stimulation of the PXR has been associated with increased cell migration and proliferation, two of the key processes involved in wound healing. We hypothesized that PXR agonists would enhance intestinal epithelial repair. Stimulation of Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells with rifaximin, rifampicin and SR12813, all potent agonists of the PXR, significantly increased wound closure. This effect was driven by p38 MAP kinase-dependent cell migration, and occurred in the absence of cell proliferation. Treating mice with a rodent specific PXR agonist, pregnenolone 16\u03b1-carbonitrile (PCN), attenuated the intestinal barrier dysfunction observed in the dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) model of experimental colitis, an effect that occurred independent of the known anti-inflammatory effects of PCN. Taken together our data indicate that the activation of the PXR can enhance intestinal epithelial repair and suggest that targeting the PXR may help to normalize intestinal barrier dysfunction observed in patients with IBD. Furthermore, our data provide additional insight into the potential mechanisms through which rifaximin elicits its clinical efficacy in the treatment of IBD.",

        "Title": "Pharmacological and pathophysiological roles of carnitine/organic cation transporters (OCTNs: SLC22A4, SLC22A5 and Slc22a21).",
        "Abstract": "The carnitine/organic cation transporter (OCTN) family consists of three transporter isoforms, i.e. OCTN1 (SLC22A4) and OCTN2 (SLC22A5) in humans and animals and Octn3 (Slc22a21) in mice. These transporters are physiologically essential to maintain appropriate systemic and tissue concentrations of carnitine by regulating its membrane transport during intestinal absorption, tissue distribution and renal reabsorption. Among them, OCTN2 is a sodium-dependent, high-affinity transporter of carnitine, and a functional defect of OCTN2 due to genetic mutation causes primary systemic carnitine deficiency (SCD). Since carnitine is essential for beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids to produce ATP, OCTN2 gene mutation causes a range of symptoms, including cardiomyopathy, skeletal muscle weakness, fatty liver and male infertility. These functional consequences of Octn2 gene mutation can be seen clearly in an animal model, jvs mouse, which exhibits the SCD phenotype. In addition, although the mechanism is not clear, single nucleotide polymorphisms of OCTN1 and OCTN2 genes are associated with increased incidences of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and asthma. OCTN1 and OCTN2 accept cationic drugs as substrates and contribute to intestinal and pulmonary absorption, tissue distribution (including to tumour cells), and renal excretion of these drugs. Modulation of the transport activity of OCTN2 by externally administered drugs may cause drug-induced secondary carnitine deficiency. Rodent Octn3 transports carnitine specifically, particularly in male reproductive tissues. Thus, the OCTNs are physiologically, pathologically and pharmacologically important. Detailed characterization of these transporters will greatly improve our understanding of the pathology associated with common diseases caused by functional deficiency of OCTNs.",

However, the significance of this compromised gut barrier function and its place in the pathogenesis of the disease remains poorly understood. The association between abnormal small intestinal permeability and a specific mutation in the NOD2 gene, which functions to modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses to intestinal bacteria, suggests a common, genetically determined pathway by which an abnormal gut barrier could result in chronic intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, rodent colitis models show that gut barrier defects precede the development of inflammatory changes. However, it remains possible that abnormal permeability is simply a consequence of mucosal inflammation. Further insight into whether abnormal barrier function is the cause or consequence of chronic intestinal inflammation will be crucial to understanding the role of intestinal permeability in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the bacterial, local, and systemic immune changes that follow ileocolonic anastomosis in a rodent model of Crohn's disease, the interleukin-10 gene-deficient (IL-10 null) mice. We divided wild-type and IL-10 null mice into three treatment groups: ileocolonic anastomosis, sham operation (ileo-ileal anastomosis), and control group without an operation. We sacrificed mice at 6 and 15 wks after the operation. At 6 wks, we assessed bacterial changes using the denaturing gel electrophoresis and similarity coefficient calculation. At both time points, we examined the small bowel for inflammation and fibrosis with histology. We measured the interferon gamma secretion by splenocytes stimulated with gastrointestinal bacterial antigens and splenocyte composition as a marker of systemic response. At 6 wks, ileocolonic anastomosis resulted in increased similarity in bacterial species between the ileum and colon. The ileocolonic anastomosis did not lead to significant inflammation in the small intestine, but it resulted in an increased collagen deposition in all animals undergoing surgery, the most pronounced fibrosis of which was present in IL-10 null mice 15 wks after ileocolonic anastomosis. Furthermore, this was associated with significantly increased interferon gamma secretion by bacterial antigen-stimulated splenocytes and a decreased number of CD11+ cells in the same experimental group. Ileocolonic anastomosis leads to bacterial changes in the terminal ileum. In the genetically susceptible host, it is associated with small bowel fibrosis and systemic immune alterations. The composition of immune cells in the spleen is altered and splenocytes hypersecrete proinflammatory cytokine (interferon gamma) when challenged with gastrointestinal bacterial antigens.",

Hence, a degradation-resistant GLP-2 analog is under investigation for treatment of Crohn's disease. However, GLP-2 increases colonic dysplasia in murine azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer. Considering the increased colon cancer risk associated with chronic colitis, we have therefore examined the effects of long-acting hGly(2)GLP-2, as well as of endogenous GLP-2 using the antagonist hGLP-2(3-33) in two novel models of inflammation-associated colon cancer: rats fed the carcinogen 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and a high-fat diet (HFD) for one or three cycles, and mice with chronic dextran sodium-sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis administered AOM. hGly(2)GLP-2 treatment of one-cycle PhIP/HFD rats increased the number of colonic aberrant crypt foci by 72 \u00b1 11% (P < 0.01). Fifty-one weeks after three PhIP/HFD cycles, hGly(2)GLP-2-treated rats had a 22% incidence of colon cancer, compared with 0% in vehicle-treated rats. AOM-DSS mice treated with vehicle or hGly(2)GLP-2 had high-grade dysplasia/colon cancer incidences of 56 and 64%, respectively, compared with 46% in hGLP-2(3-33)-treated AOM-DSS animals (P < 0.05). Unexpectedly, hGLP-2(3-33) also reduced the colitis damage score by 32.0 \u00b1 8.4% (P < 0.05). All high-grade dysplastic/cancerous tumors had nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin although \u03b2-catenin mRNA transcript and protein levels did not differ between treatment groups. GLP-2 receptor mRNA expression also was not different. However, hGLP-2(3-33)-treated mice had markedly reduced numbers of doublecortin-and-calmodulin-kinase-like-1-positive stem cells, by 73.7 \u00b1 8.6% (P < 0.05).

Animal models and therapeutic protocols in patients have demonstrated their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties towards adaptive immune cells. However, the basis of their immune suppression remains hotly debated. In the present review, we discuss the comparative isolation of human and rodent MSCs, their respective immune properties, whether constitutive or licensed by inflammatory or immune reactions, as well as differential efficacy as observed in GVHD clinical trials and related mouse models. Rodent MSCs display a number of immune differences with human MSCs regarding to ease of isolation, licensing pathways resulting in immunosuppression, and expression of immune mediators. These observations urge for caution when translating results generated in murine models into clinical settings.",

        "Title": "Spironolactone and colitis: increased mortality in rodents and in humans.",
        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease causes intestinal inflammation leading to intestinal fibrosis. Spironolactone is an antifibrotic medication commonly used in heart failure to reduce mortality. We examined whether spironolactone is antifibrotic in the context of intestinal inflammation. In vitro, spironolactone repressed fibrogenesis in transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2)-stimulated human colonic myofibroblasts. However, spironolactone therapy significantly increased mortality in two rodent models of inflammation-induced intestinal fibrosis, suggesting spironolactone could be harmful during intestinal inflammation. Since inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients rarely receive spironolactone therapy, we examined whether spironolactone use was associated with mortality in a common cause of inflammatory colitis, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Spironolactone use during CDI infection was associated with increased mortality in a retrospective cohort of 4008 inpatients (15.9% vs. 9.1%, n = 390 deaths, P < 0.0001). In patients without liver disease, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for inpatient mortality associated with 80 mg spironolactone was 1.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51-2.63) In contrast to the main effect of spironolactone mortality, multivariate modeling revealed a protective interaction between liver disease and spironolactone dose. The adjusted OR for mortality after CDI was 1.96 (95% CI: 1.50-2.55) for patients without liver disease on spironolactone vs. 1.28 (95% CI: 0.82-2.00) for patients with liver disease on spironolactone when compared to a reference group without liver disease or spironolactone use. We propose that discontinuation of spironolactone in patients without liver disease during CDI could reduce hospital mortality by 2-fold, potentially reducing mortality from CDI by 35,000 patients annually across Europe and the U.S.",

        "Abstract": "GP-BAR1, a member G protein coupled receptor superfamily, is a cell surface bile acid-activated receptor highly expressed in the ileum and colon. In monocytes, ligation of GP-BAR1 by secondary bile acids results in a cAMP-dependent attenuation of cytokine generation. To investigate the role GP-BAR1 in regulating intestinal homeostasis and inflammation-driven immune dysfunction in rodent models of colitis. Colitis was induced in wild type and GP-BAR1(-/-) mice by DSS and TNBS administration. Potential GP-BAR1 agonists were identified by in silico screening and computational docking studies. GP-BAR1(-/-) mice develop an abnormal morphology of colonic mucous cells and an altered molecular architecture of epithelial tight junctions with increased expression and abnormal subcellular distribution of zonulin 1 resulting in increased intestinal permeability and susceptibility to develop severe colitis in response to DSS at early stage of life. By in silico screening and docking studies we identified ciprofloxacin as a GP-BAR1 ligand. In monocytes, ciprofloxacin increases cAMP concentrations and attenuates TNF\u03b1 release induced by TLR4 ligation in a GP-BAR1 dependent manner. Treating mice rendered colitic by TNBS with ciprofloxacin and oleanolic acid, a well characterized GP-BAR1 ligand, abrogates signs and symptoms of colitis. Colonic expression of GP-BAR1 mRNA increases in rodent models of colitis and tissues from Crohn's disease patients. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrates that \u224890% of CD14+ cells isolated from the lamina propria of TNBS-treated mice stained positively for GP-BAR1. GP-BAR1 regulates intestinal barrier structure. Its expression increases in rodent models of colitis and Crohn's disease. Ciprofloxacin is a GP-BAR1 ligand.",

Therefore, more than 40 different protein or lipid kinases can be regarded as potential small-molecule inhibitor targets to approach a therapy of acute inflammation, such as septic syndrome, and especially chronic inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. Besides the general considerations about selectivity and potency of small-molecule kinase inhibitors, in this chapter special emphasis is put on the inflammation-specific methods and assays available for testing potential small-molecule inhibitors for their anti-inflammatory activity. Examples for human cell-based assays for characterization of the effect of inhibitors on contribution of various cell types, such as monocytes, neutrophils, mast cells, T-cells, and synovial fibroblasts, to the inflammatory scenario are given. It is further demonstrated how these assays are complemented by rodent models for septic syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Finally, it is discussed how the results obtained by these methods can be further validated and which future strategies for the treatment of chronic inflammation will exist.",

        "Abstract": "Segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are members of the commensal intestinal microbiome. They are known to contribute to the postnatal maturation of the gut immune system, but also to augment inflammatory conditions in chronic diseases such as Crohn's disease. Living primary tissue slices are ultrathin multicellular sections of the intestine and provide a unique opportunity to analyze tissue-specific immune responses ex vivo. This study aimed to investigate whether supplementation of the gut flora with SFB promotes T helper 17 (Th17) cell responses in primary intestinal tissue slices ex vivo. Primary tissue slices were prepared from the small intestine of healthy\u00a0Taconic mice with SFB-positive and SFB-negative microbiomes and stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 or Concanavalin A. SFB-positive and -negative mice exhibited distinct microbiome compositions and Th17 cell frequencies in the intestine and complex microbiota including SFB induced up to 15-fold increase in Th17 cell-associated mediators, serum amyloid A (SAA), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses ex vivo. This phenotype could be transmitted by co-housing of mice. Our findings highlight that changes in the gut microbiome can be observed in primary intestinal tissue slices ex vivo.

        "Abstract": "Developing a noninvasive imaging method to detect immune system activation with a high temporal resolution is key to improving inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management. In this study, granzyme B (GZMB), typically released from cytotoxic T and natural killer cells, was targeted using PET with <sup>68</sup>Ga-NOTA-GZP (where GZP is \u03b2-Ala-Gly-Gly-Ile-Glu-Phe-Asp-CHO) to detect early intestinal inflammation in murine models of colitis. <b>Methods:</b> Bioinformatic analysis was used to assess the potential of GZMB as a biomarker for detecting IBD and predicting response to treatment. Human active and quiescent Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis tissues were stained for GZMB. We used IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) as an IBD model, wild-type C57BL/6J mice as a control, and anti-tumor necrosis factor as therapy. We used a murine GZMB-binding peptide conjugated to a NOTA chelator (NOTA-GZP) labeled with <sup>68</sup>Ga as the PET tracer. PET imaging was conducted at 1, 3, and 4 wk after colitis induction to evaluate temporal changes. <b>Results:</b> Bioinformatic analysis showed that GZMB gene expression is significantly upregulated in human ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease compared with the noninflamed bowel by 2.98-fold and 1.92-fold, respectively; its expression is lower by 2.16-fold in treatment responders than in nonresponders. Immunofluorescence staining of human tissues demonstrated a significantly higher GZMB in patients with active than with quiescent IBD (<i>P</i> = 0.032).<sup>68</sup>Ga-NOTA-GZP PET imaging showed significantly increased bowel uptake in IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice with DSS-induced colitis compared with vehicle-treated IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice (SUV<sub>mean</sub>, 0.75 vs. 0.24; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and both vehicle- and DSS-treated wild-type mice (SUV<sub>mean</sub>, 0.26 and 0.37; <i>P</i> < 0.001). In the IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> DSS-induced colitis model, the bowel PET probe uptake decreased in response to treatment with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (SUV<sub>mean</sub>, 0.32; <i>P</i> < 0.001). There was a 4-fold increase in colonic uptake of <sup>68</sup>Ga-NOTA-GZP in the colitis model compared with the control 1 wk after colitis induction. The uptake gradually decreased to approximately 2-fold by 4 wk after IBD induction; however, the inflamed bowel uptake remained significantly higher than control at all time points (week 4 SUV<sub>mean</sub>, 0.23 vs. 0.08; <i>P</i> = 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> GZMB is a promising biomarker to detect active IBD and predict response to treatment. This study provides compelling evidence to translate GZMB PET for imaging IBD activity in clinical settings.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), an inflammatory disease, include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Dysregulated autoimmune response to gut dysbiosis is mainly involved in the pathogenesis of IBD and is triggered by various inciting environmental factors. With its rising prevalence in every continent, IBD has evolved into a global disease, which is on the rise, affecting people of all ages. There is a growing incidence of IBD in the elderly population, as evidenced by epidemiological data. IBD is characterized by an inflammatory process that requires a lifelong treatment. The main challenge in IBD management is the adverse side effects associated with almost all of the currently available drugs. Hence, there is a search for drugs with more efficacy and fewer side effects. Natural products with great structural diversity and ease of modification chemically are being explored, as they were shown to control IBD by safely suppressing pro-inflammatory pathways. The present study aims at understanding the role of mangiferin, a COX-2 inhibitor isolated from tubers of <i>Pueraria tuberosa</i> in the treatment of IBD and colon cancer, <i>in vitro</i> on the Caco-2 human colon cancer cell line and <i>in vivo</i> in the acetic acid-induced IBD mouse model. In the acetic acid-induced colitis model, it prevented the decrease in length of the colon, mucosal erosion, and cellular infiltration in a dose-dependent manner. The expression levels of various pro-inflammatory markers like COX-2, IL1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, INF-\u03b3, IL-6, NLRP3, and caspase-1 were downregulated in an acetic acid-induced mouse model on treatment with mangiferin in a dose dependent manner. Mangiferin also showed anticancer effects on Caco-2 cells by increasing the expression of Fas ligand, Fas receptor, FADD, caspase-8, and caspase-3 proteins, whereas Bid and Bcl-2 proteins showed decreased expression. These data suggest that mangiferin, an inhibitor of COX, induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells <i>in vitro</i> and protects mice from acetic acid-induced colitis <i>in vivo</i>.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's Disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by intestinal fibrosis, severely impacting patient quality of life. The molecular mechanisms driving this fibrosis remain inadequately understood. Recent evidence implicates mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) in CD pathogenesis, particularly through its exosome secretion, which may influence fibrogenic pathways. Understanding the role of MAT-derived exosomes is crucial for unraveling these molecular processes. This study aims to elucidate the role of MAT-derived exosomes in CD-related intestinal fibrosis. We focus on investigating their molecular composition and the potential impact on fibrosis progression, with an emphasis on identifying novel therapeutic targets. We induced chronic intestinal inflammation in mice using dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS), simulating CD-like fibrosis. Exosomes were isolated from DNBS-treated mice (MG) and normal controls (NG) for characterization using electron microscopy and proteomic analysis. Additionally, human colonic fibroblasts were exposed to exosomes from CD patients and healthy individuals, with subsequent assessment of fibrogenesis through proteomic and RNA sequencing analyses. Proteomic analyses revealed a significant activation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway in MG-treated mice compared to controls, correlating with enhanced intestinal fibrosis. In vitro experiments demonstrated that colonic fibroblasts exposed to CD patient-derived exosomes exhibited increased fibrogenic activity. Protein docking and co-immunoprecipitation studies suggested a critical interaction between TINAGL1 and SMAD4, enhancing fibrosis. Importantly, in vivo experiments corroborated that recombinant TINAGL1 protein exacerbated DNBS-induced intestinal fibrosis. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of MAT-derived exosomes, particularly those carrying TINAGL1, in the progression of intestinal fibrosis in CD. The involvement of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, especially the SMAD4 protein, offers new insights into the molecular mechanisms of CD-related fibrosis and presents potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",

Complanatuside A (CA), a flavonol glycoside, exerts anti-inflammatory activities and our study aimed to identify its effect on TNBS-induced colitis and the possible mechanisms. We found that CA alleviated the symptoms of colitis in TNBS mice, as demonstrated by prevented weight loss and colon length shortening, as well as decreased disease activity index scores, inflammatory scores, and levels of proinflammatory factors. Flow cytometry analysis showed that CA markedly reduced the percentage of Th17 cells while increasing the percentage of Treg cells in TNBS mice. Under Th17 cell polarizing conditions, CA inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cells while the Treg cell differentiation was elevated under Treg cell polarizing conditions. Furthermore, it was observed that JAK2 interacted with CA through six hydrogen bonds via molecular docking. The phosphorylation of JAK2/STAT3 was reduced by CA, which might be correlated with the protective effect of CA on colitis. In conclusion, CA reduced the imbalance of Th17/Treg cells by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in TNBS-induced colitis, which may provide novel strategies for CD treatment.",

To determine whether these findings could be applicable to atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis vulgaris (PV), PBMCs isolated from patients with AD and PV were first subjected to immunological profiling. Subsequently, NSG mice were reconstituted with these PBMCs. Hierarchical clustering and network analysis revealed a distinct profile of patients with AD and PV with activated CD4+ T cells (CD69, CD25) occupying a central position in the AD network and CD4+ CD134+ cells acting as the main hub in the PV network. After dermal application of DMSO, both NSG mice reconstituted with PBMCs from donors with AD (ie, NSG-AD mice) and NSG mice reconstituted with PBMCs from donors with PV (ie, NSG-PV mice) exhibited increased clinical, skin, and histological scores. Immunohistochemical analysis, frequencies of splenic human leukocytes, and cytokine expression levels indicated that CD4+ CD69+ cells, M1 and TSLP receptor-expressing monocytes, switched B cells, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 3 were the driving factors of inflammation in NSG-AD mice. In contrast, inflammation in NSG-PV mice was characterized by an increase in fibroblasts in the epidermis, frequencies of CD1a-expressing monocytes, and IL-17 levels. Therefore, the pathological phenotypes of NSG-AD mice and NSG-PV mice differ and partially reflect the respective human diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Previous reports have shown that preventing excessive intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis is a crucial approach for protecting the intestinal barrier in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Magnolin (MGL) has various biological activities, including antiapoptotic activities, but its role in CD has largely not been determined. This study investigated how MGL impacts CD-like colitis and the underlying mechanism involved. Mice were treated with TNBS to establish a disease model, and these mice were used to assess the therapeutic effects of MGL on CD-like colitis. TNF-\u03b1-treated colon organoids were used to evaluate the impact of MGL on intestinal barrier function and IEC apoptosis. Enrichment analysis was performed to examine the potential pathways through which MGL inhibits IEC apoptosis. Finally, rescue experiments showed the mechanism by which MGL suppresses IEC apoptosis. The animal experiments demonstrated that MGL treatment alleviated the weight loss, colon shortening, elevated disease activity index (DAI) scores, increased colitis histological scores and upregulated inflammatory factor expression that were observed in model mice. MGL ameliorated intestinal barrier dysfunction and the loss of tight junction (TJ) proteins (ZO-1 and Claudin-1) by inhibiting IEC apoptosis in both TNBS-treated mice and TNF-\u03b1-treated colon organoids. MGL inhibited the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, thus safeguarding the intestinal barrier and alleviating CD-like colitis in vivo and in vitro. MGL improves the intestinal barrier integrity and prevents CD-like colitis by inhibiting IEC apoptosis. The potential mechanism of its anti-apoptotic impact on IECs could be associated with the PI3K/AKT pathway, presenting novel approaches and avenues for the clinical management of CD.",

Herein, we used cell culture, mouse models, and human specimens to examine if ER stress in ILC3s impacts IBD pathophysiology. We show that mouse intestinal ILC3s exhibited a 24h-rhythmic expression pattern of the master ER stress response regulator, IRE1\u03b1/XBP1. Proinflammatory cytokine IL-23 selectively stimulated IRE1\u03b1/XBP1 in mouse ILC3s through mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). IRE1\u03b1/XBP1 was activated in ILC3s of mice exposed to experimental colitis and in inflamed human IBD specimens. Mice with Ire1\u03b1 deletion in ILC3s (Ire1\u03b1\u0394Rorc) showed reduced expression of ER stress response and cytokine genes including Il22 in ILC3s and were highly vulnerable to infections and colitis. Administration of IL-22 counteracted their colitis susceptibility. In human ILC3s, IRE1 inhibitors suppressed cytokine production, which was upregulated by an IRE1 activator. Moreover, the frequencies of intestinal XBP1s+ ILC3s in Crohn's disease patients before administration of ustekinumab, an anti-IL-12/IL-23 antibody, positively correlated with response to treatment. We demonstrate that a non-canonical mtROS-IRE1\u03b1/XBP1 pathway augments cytokine production by ILC3s and identify XBP1s+ ILC3s as a potential biomarker for predicting response to anti-IL-23 therapies in IBD.",

We examined KLF11 expression levels in diseased and normal colon mucosal tissues from 12 CD patients and 12 patients with colorectal cancer using immunofluorescence staining. KLF11 expression was also detected in the colon mucosal tissues of a mouse model of 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. A recombinant adenoviral vector was used to upregulate KLF11 expression in the mouse models and the changes in intestinal inflammation was observed. A Caco-2 cell model with stable KLF11 overexpression was constructed by lentiviral infection. The effect of KLF11 overexpression on expressions of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway proteins was investigated using immunoblotting in both the mouse and cell models. The mouse models were treated with coumermycin A1, a JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway agonist, and the changes in intestinal inflammatory responses were observed. The expression level of KLF11 was significantly lowered in both the clinical specimens of diseased colon mucosal tissues and the colon tissues of mice with TNBS-induced colitis (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Adenovirus-mediated upregulation of KLF11 significantly improved intestinal inflammation and reduced the expression levels of inflammatory factors in the intestinal mucosa of the colitis mouse models (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Overexpression of KLF11 significantly inhibited the expression levels of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 in intestinal mucosal tissues of the mouse models and in Caco-2 cells (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Treatment with coumermycin A1 obviously inhibited the effect of KLF11 upregulation for improving colitis and significantly increased the expression levels of inflammatory factors in the intestinal mucosa of the mouse models (<i>P</i> < 0.05). KLF11 is downregulated in the intestinal mucosa in CD, and upregulation of KLF11 can improve intestinal inflammation and reduce the production of inflammatory factors probably by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "The risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in extensive ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's colitis. Gut microbiota have been implicated in the pathogenesis of CRC via multiple mechanisms, including the release of reactive oxygen species and genotoxins, and induction of inflammation as well as activation of the immune response. Gut microbiota can enhance their carcinogenic and pro-inflammatory properties by organizing into biofilms, potentially making them more resistant to the host's immune system and to antibiotics. Colonic biofilms have the capacity to invade colonic tissue and accelerate tumorigenesis in tumor-prone models of mice. In the context of IBD, the prevalence of biofilms has been estimated to be up to 95%. Although the relationship between chronic inflammation and molecular mediators that contribute to IBD-associated CRC is well established, the role of gut microbiota and biofilms in this sequence is not fully understood. Because CRC can still arise in the absence of histologic inflammation, there is a growing interest in identifying chemopreventive agents against IBD-associated CRC. 5-aminosalicylates, commonly used in the treatment of UC, have antimicrobial and anti-carcinogenic properties that might have a role in the chemoprevention of CRC via the inhibition or modulation of carcinogenic gut microbiota and potentially biofilm formation. Whether biologics and other IBD-targeted therapies can decrease the progression towards dysplasia and CRC via mechanisms independent of inflammation is still unknown. Further research is warranted to identify potential new microbial targets of therapy for chemoprevention of dysplasia and CRC in IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Neutrophil-myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme-containing peroxidase which produces excess amounts of hypochlorous acid during inflammation. While pharmacological MPO inhibition mitigates all indices of experimental colitis, no studies have corroborated the role of MPO using knockout (KO) models. Therefore, we investigated MPO deficient mice in a murine model of colitis. Wild type (Wt) and MPO-deficient mice were treated with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) in a chronic model of experimental colitis with three acute cycles of DSS-induced colitis over 63 days, emulating IBD relapse and remission cycles. Mice were immunologically profiled at the gut muscoa and the faecal microbiome was assessed via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Contrary to previous pharmacological antagonist studies targeting MPO, MPO-deficient mice showed no protection from experimental colitis during cyclical DSS-challenge. We are the first to report drastic faecal microbiota shifts in MPO-deficient mice, showing a significantly different microbiome profile on Day 1 of treatment, with a similar shift and distinction on Day 29 (half-way point), via qualitative and quantitative descriptions of phylogenetic distances. Herein, we provide the first evidence of substantial microbiome shifts in MPO-deficiency, which may influence disease progression. Our findings have significant implications for the utility of MPO-KO mice in investigating disease models.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an inflammatory condition affecting the colon and small intestine, with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis being the major types. Individuals with long-term IBD are at an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Early growth response protein 1 (Egr1) is a nuclear protein that functions as a transcriptional regulator. Egr1 is known to control the expression of numerous genes and play a role in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. While IBD has been associated with severe inflammation, the precise mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of Egr1 in the development of IBD. High levels of Egr1 expression were observed in a mouse model of colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), as determined by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Chronic DSS treatment showed that <i>Egr1</i> knockout (KO) mice exhibited resistance to the development of IBD, as determined by changes in their body weight and disease scores. Additionally, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and IHC staining demonstrated decreased expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, as well as matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12). Putative Egr1 binding sites were identified within the MMP12 promoter region. Through reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, it was shown that Egr1 binds to the MMP12 promoter and regulates MMP12 expression. In conclusion, we found that Egr1 plays a role in the inflammation process of IBD through transcriptionally activating MMP12.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammation-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction is not only a pathological feature of Crohn's disease (CD) but also an important therapeutic target. Sclareol (SCL) is a nontoxic natural plant compound with anti-inflammatory effect, but its role in CD has not been established. In vivo studies of mice with TNBS-induced colitis were carried out to evaluate the effects of SCL on CD-like colitis and intestinal barrier function. In vitro, a TNF-\u03b1-induced colonic organoid model was established to test the direct effect of SCL on inflammation-induced intestinal barrier injure and inflammatory response. The Nrf2/NF-\u03baB/MLCK signalling was analysed to explore the mechanism of SCL. In vivo, SCL largely alleviated the colitis in TNBS mice, as evidenced by improvements in the weight loss, colitis symptoms, endoscopic score, macroscopic histological score, and histological inflammation score. Moreover, SCL significantly improved intestinal barrier dysfunction, manifested as reduced intestinal permeability and decreased intestinal bacterial translocation in TNBS mice. Importantly, SCL antagonised the intestinal mucosal inflammation while protecting tight junctions in TNBS mice. In vitro, SCL largely depressed pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and improved intestinal epithelial permeability in a TNF-\u03b1-induced colonic organoid model. In the context of CD, the protective effects of SCL against inflammation and intestinal barrier damage are at least partially results from the Nrf2 signalling activation and the NF-\u03baB/MLCK signalling inhibition. SCL improved intestinal barrier dysfunction and alleviated CD-like colitis, possibly through modulation of Nrf2/NF-\u03baB/MLCK signalling. In view of SCL's safety profile, there is hope that it will be useful in the clinic.",

        "Title": "New insights into the interactions between the gut microbiota and the inflammatory response to ulcerative colitis\u00a0in a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate and possible mechanisms of action for treatment with PE&AFWE.",
        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a heterogeneous state of chronic intestinal inflammation. Intestinal innate immunity, including innate immune cells, defends against pathogens and excessive entry of gut microbiota, while preserving immune tolerance to resident intestinal microbiota, and may be characterized by its capacity to produce a rapid and nonspecific reaction. The association between microbiota dysbiosis and the pathogenesis of IBD is complex and dynamic. When the intestinal ecosystem is in dysbiosis, the reduced abundance and diversity of intestinal gut microbiota make the host more vulnerable to the attack of exogenous and endogenous pathogenic gut microbiota. The aim of our study was to comprehensively assess the relationship between microbial populations within UC, the signaling pathways of pathogenic gut microbe therein and the inflammatory response, as well as to understand the effects of using PE&AFWE (poppy extract [Papaver nudicaule L.] and Artemisia frigida Willd. extract) on UC modulation. A UC mouse model was established by inducing SPF-grade C57BL/6 mice using dextrose sodium sulfate (DSS). Based on metagenomic sequencing to characterize the gut microbiome, the relationship between gut microbiota dysbiosis and gut microbiota was further studied using random forest and Bayesian network analysis methods, as well as histopathological analysis. (1) We found that the 5 gut microbiota with the highest relative abundance of inflammatory bowel disease UC model gut microbiota were consistent with the top 5 ranked natural bacteria. There were three types of abundance changes in the model groups: increases (Chlamydiae/Proteobacteria and Deferribacteres), decreases (Firmicutes), and no significant changes (Bacteroidetes). The UC model group was significantly different from the control group, with 1308 differentially expressed species with abundance changes greater than or equal to 2-fold. (2) The proportion of the fecal flora in the UC group decreased by 37.5% in the Firmicutes and increased by 14.29% in the proportion of Proteobacteria compared to the control group before treatment. (3) The significantly enriched and increased signaling pathways screened were the 'arachidonic acid metabolic pathway' and the 'phagosomal pathway', which both showed a decreasing trend after drug administration. (4) Based on the causal relationship between different OTUs and the UC model/PE&AFWE administration, screening for directly relevant OTU networks, the UC group was found to directly affect OTU69, followed by a cascade of effects on OTU12, OTU121, OTU93, and OTU7, which may be the pathway of action that initiated the pathological changes in normal mice. (5) We identified a causal relationship between common differentially expressed OTUs and PE&AFWE and UC in the pre- and post-PE&AFWE-treated groups. Thereby, we learned that PE&AFWE can directly affect OTU90, after which it inhibits UC, inhibiting the activity of arachidonic acid metabolic pathway by affecting OTU118, which in turn inhibits the colonization of gut microbiota by OTU93 and OTU7. (6) Histopathological observation and scoring (HS) of the colon showed that there was a significant difference between the model group and the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and that there was a significant recovery in both the sulfasalazine (SASP)and the PE&AFWE groups after the administration of the drug (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). We demonstrated causal effects and inflammatory metabolic pathways in gut microbiota dysbiosis and IBD, with five opportunistic pathogens directly contributing to IBD. PE&AFWE reduced the abundance of proteobacteria in the gut microbiota, and histopathology showed significant improvement.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate whether bergapten (BG), a furanocoumarin phytohormone, holds promise for Crohn's disease (CD)-like colitis treatment and to preliminarily explore its potential mechanisms. 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesufonic acid (TNBS)-treated mice were applied to establish an in vivo research model, and BG was administered with different concentrations. The status of mice in each group was evaluated by disease activity index (DAI), and the severity was evaluated by pathological sections. The intestinal barrier was assessed by measuring in vivo intestinal permeability, peripheral blood intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) levels, epithelial resistance values, and tight junction protein levels. Markers were then used to assess Th17/Treg levels, mitophagy, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\u03b3/ nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway. BG significantly reduced colon tissue damage in a concentration-dependent manner. DAI scores showed that the loose feces, occult blood, and weight loss of mice in the BG treatment were significantly reduced, and pathological section results revealed reduced inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis. Reduced serum FITC-dextran and I-FABP and increased levels of epithelial resistance and tight junction proteins support that the intestinal barrier was protected upon BG. The proportion of Th17 in mesenteric lymph nodes increased while Treg decreased in the model group. BG treatment effectively reduced the conversion of Treg to Th17. Additionally, BG was found to enhance mitophagy and activate the PPAR\u03b3/NF-\u03baB signaling. BG demonstrates promising effects in ameliorating intestinal barrier damage and Th17/Treg imbalance in a murine model of CD-like colitis, while also promoting intracellular mitophagy. The PPAR\u03b3/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway may serve as a key mediator of BG's regulatory mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease is associated with carcinogenesis, which limits the prognosis of the patients. The local expression of proteinases and proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR<sub>1</sub>) increases in inflammatory bowel disease. The present study investigated the therapeutic effects of PAR<sub>1</sub> antagonism on colitis-associated carcinogenesis. A colitis-associated carcinogenesis model was prepared in mice by treatment with azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). PAR<sub>1</sub> antagonist E5555 was administered in long- and short-term protocol, starting on the day of AOM injection and 1 week after completing AOM/DSS treatment, respectively. The fecal samples were collected for metagenome analysis of gut microbiota. The intestinal myofibroblasts of the Crohn's disease patients were used to elucidate underlying cellular mechanisms. Caco-2 cells were used to investigate a possible source of PAR<sub>1</sub> agonist proteinases. AOM/DSS model showed weight loss, diarrhea, tumor development, inflammation, fibrosis, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines. The \u03b2-diversity, but not \u03b1-diversity, of microbiota significantly differed between AOM/DSS and control mice. E5555 alleviated these pathological changes and altered the microbiota \u03b2-diversity in AOM/DSS mice. The thrombin expression was up-regulated in tumor and non-tumor areas, whereas PAR<sub>1</sub> mRNA expression was higher in tumor areas compared with non-tumor areas. E5555 inhibited thrombin-triggered elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, as well as IL6-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in intestinal myofibroblasts. Caco-2 cell-conditioned medium contained immunoreactive thrombin, which cleaved the recombinant protein containing the extracellular domain of PAR<sub>1</sub> at the thrombin cleavage site. PAR<sub>1</sub> antagonism is proposed to be a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and its associated carcinogenesis.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's and ulcerative colitis are common conditions associated with inflammatory bowel disease as well as intestinal flora and epithelial barrier dysfunction. A novel fermented <i>Lactobacillus brevis</i> (AL0035) herein assayed in a trinitro benzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis mice model after oral administration significantly counteracted the body weight loss and improves the disease activity index and histological injury scores. AL0035 significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression of different pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-gamma) and enhanced the expression of IL-10. In addition, the probiotic promoted the expression of tight junction proteins, such as ZO-1, keeping the intestinal mucosal barrier function to attenuate colitis symptoms in mice. Markers of inflammation cascade such as myeloperoxidase (MPO) and PPAR-gamma measured in the colon were also modified by AL0035 treatment. AL0035 was also able to reduce different lymphocyte markers' infiltration in the colon (GATA-3, T-Bet, NK1.1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), a key chemokine involved in the migration and infiltration of monocytes/macrophages in the immunological surveillance of tissues and inflammation. In colonic microbiota profile analysis through 16S rRNA sequencing, AL0035 increased the microbial diversity depleted by TNBS administration and the relative abundance of the Lactobacillaceae and Lachnospiraceae families, whereas it decreased the abundance of Proteobacteria. Altogether, these data indicated that AL0035 could lower the severity of colitis induced by TNBS by regulating inflammatory cytokines, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins and modulating intestinal microbiota, thus preventing tissue damage induced by colitis.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and smokers have a higher incidence of intestinal disorders. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the transcriptomic changes in the lungs and intestines, and the fecal microbial composition after cigarette smoke exposure. Mice were exposed to cigarette smoke and their lung and ileum tissues were analyzed by RNA sequencing. The top 15 differentially expressed genes were investigated in publicly available gene expression datasets of COPD and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. The murine microbiota composition was determined by 16S rRNA sequencing. Increased expression of MMP12, GPNMB, CTSK, CD68, SPP1, CCL22, and ITGAX was found in the lungs of cigarette smoke-exposed mice and COPD patients. Changes in the intestinal expression of CD79B, PAX5, and FCRLA were observed in the ileum of cigarette smoke-exposed mice and CD patients. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokine profiles and adhesion molecules in both the lungs and intestines of cigarette smoke-exposed mice were profoundly changed. An altered intestinal microbiota composition and a reduction in bacterial diversity was observed in cigarette smoke-exposed mice. Altered gene expression in the murine lung was detected after cigarette smoke exposure, which might simulate COPD-like alterations. The transcriptomic changes in the intestine of cigarette smoke-exposed mice had some similarities with those of CD patients and were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome. Future research could benefit from investigating the specific mechanisms underlying the observed gene expression changes due to cigarette smoke exposure, focusing on identifying potential therapeutic targets for COPD and CD.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by recurrent inflammatory reactions in the intestinal mucosa, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) has been observed to increase during the progression of IBD. Flavokawain B (FKB), a natural chalcone with potent anti-inflammatory activity, exerts its effects through inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of FKB targeting TLR2 in IBD. C57BL/6\u00a0J mice were treated with 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7\u00a0days, with administration of FKB or TLR2 inhibitor C29 starting on day 2 to establish the model of IBD. In vitro, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were stimulated with the TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 to explore the therapeutic effect of FKB and its pharmacological mechanism. Compared with the model group, the FKB-treated group showed significant reductions in colitis-related injuries in the IBD mouse model, including weight gain, increased colon length and reduced inflammation. FKB decreased the formation of TLR2-MyD88 complex by targeting TLR2, leading to suppression of downstream NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Similar therapeutic effects were observed in the C29-treated group. Additionally, in vitro data suggested that FKB exerted its anti-inflammatory effect by targeting TLR2 and inhibiting Pam3CSK4-induced activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway. The anti-inflammatory effects of FKB were demonstrated through drug affinity responsive target stability assay and cellular thermal shift assay, revealing its binding affinity to TLR2. By inhibiting the activation of the TLR2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, FKB effectively prevented DSS-induced IBD and exhibited promising potential as a therapeutic candidate for IBD treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease that affects the entire digestive tract. IBD can be classified as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. The key symptoms of IBD include the emergence of abscesses or pustules, pronounced abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, fistulas, and intestinal narrowing, all of which can greatly affect a patient's daily well-being. Several factors, including bacterial infections, immune response irregularities, and changes in the intestinal milieu, can contribute to the onset of IBD. The aim of this study was investigating the role of cirsimaritin in reducing the severity of colitis in animal model. To induce colitis in laboratory Swiss albino mice, a 4% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) concoction was provided in their hydration source for a duration of six days. Before the onset of colitis, mice were treated with cirsimaritin (10 mg/kg) once daily to evaluate its potential treatment effects against DSS-induced inflammation. The results showed that 10 mg/kg of cirsimaritin decreased colitis severity (<i>P</i><0.05). Moreover, cirsimaritin successfully reversed the detrimental effects induced by DSS, including weight reduction, colon truncation, tissue-related damage, increased levels of inflammatory cells in the affected region, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Our findings suggest that cirsimaritin can effectively alleviate acute colitis triggered by DSS.",

We aimed to further test the host response to fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) from Crohn's disease patients on mucosal homeostasis in ex-germ-free (xGF) mice. We characterized and transferred fecal microbiota from healthy patients and patients with defined Crohn's ileocolitis (CD_L3) to germ-free mice and analyzed the resulting microbial and mucosal homeostasis by 16S profiling, shotgun metagenomics, histology, immunofluorescence (IF) and RNAseq analysis. We observed a markedly reduced engraftment of CD_L3 microbiome compared to healthy control microbiota. FMT from CD_L3 patients did not lead to ileitis but resulted in colitis with features consistent with CD: a discontinued pattern of colitis, more proximal colonic localization, enlarged isolated lymphoid follicles and/or tertiary lymphoid organ neogenesis, and a transcriptomic pattern consistent with epithelial reprograming and promotion of the Paneth cell-like signature in the proximal colon and immune dysregulation characteristic of CD. The observed inflammatory response was associated with persistently increased abundance of <i>Ruminococcus gnavus, Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum, Faecalimonas umbilicate, Blautia hominis</i>, <i>Clostridium butyricum</i>, and <i>C. paraputrificum</i> and unexpected growth of toxigenic <i>C. difficile</i>, which was below the detection level in the community used for inoculation. Our study provides the first evidence that the transfer of a dysbiotic community from CD patients can lead to spontaneous inflammatory changes in the colon of xGF mice and identifies a signature microbial community capable of promoting colonization of pathogenic and conditionally pathogenic bacteria.",

        "Abstract": "Host molecular responses to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in ulcerative colitis are not well understood. Here, we profile the human colonic mucosal transcriptome prior to and following FMT or placebo to identify molecules regulated during disease remission. FMT alters the transcriptome above the effect of placebo (n\u2009=\u200975 vs 3 genes, q\u2009<\u20090.05), including modulation of structural, metabolic and inflammatory pathways. This response is attributed to responders with no consistency observed in non-responders. Regulated pathways in responders include tight junctions, calcium signalling and xenobiotic metabolism. Genes significantly regulated longitudinally in responders post-FMT could discriminate them from responders and non-responders at baseline and non-responders post-FMT, with GBP5 and IRF4 downregulation being associated with remission. Female mice with a deletion of GBP5 are more resistant to developing colitis than their wild-type littermates, showing higher colonic IRF4 phosphorylation. The colonic mucosal response discriminates UC remission following FMT, with GBP5 playing a detrimental role in colitis.",

        "Abstract": "Objective To investigate the regulatory role of natural plant compound prunetin (PRU) on the intestinal epithelial inflammation and the barrier structure in Crohn's disease-like colitis. Methods A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury model of colonic organoids and a 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced mouse colitis model were established to evaluate the effects of PRU on the intestinal epithelial inflammation and intestinal barrier. In addition, network pharmacological predictions, combined with in vitro and in vivo studies, were used to analyze the molecular mechanisms by which PRU modulates intestinal epithelial inflammation and intestinal barrier in CD-like colitis. Results PRU inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1\u03b2 in LPS-induced colonic organoids, and ameliorated the colitis symptoms in TNBS-induced mice, including body mass loss, elevated disease activity index and increased inflammation scores. Meanwhile, PRU promoted the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and claudin-1) and improved their translocation restoration in LPS-induced colonic organoids and TNBS-induced intestinal epithelial cells, while maintaining the intestinal barrier structure. Mechanistically, PRU targeted the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and inhibited the activation of the TLR4/myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) signaling pathway. Conclusion PRU can antagonize TLR4/MyD88 signaling, thereby inhibiting intestinal epithelial inflammation and protecting against intestinal barrier damage, which helps ameliorate Crohn's disease-like colitis.",

        "Abstract": "Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) is an intracellular sensor for muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a degradation product of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (PGN). PGN stimulates cell-surface Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) independently of NOD2, indicating the presence of crosstalk between extracellular TLR2 and intracellular NOD2 upon exposure to PGN. NOD2-deficient mice were sensitive, while TLR2-deficient mice were resistant to experimental colitis induced by intrarectal administration of PGN. Severe colitis in NOD2-deficient mice was accompanied by increased expression of nuclear factor-kappa B-dependent cytokines and decreased expression of autophagy-related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1). MDP activation of NOD2 enhanced autophagy mediated by TLR2 in human dendritic cells. mRNA expression of TLR2 tended to be higher in the colonic mucosa of patients with active ulcerative colitis compared to that of those in remission. Induction of remission was associated with increased mRNA expression of ATG16L1 in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. Conversely, mRNA expression of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 was higher in the inflammatory colonic mucosa of patients with active disease than in the non-inflamed mucosa of patients in remission, in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. These findings highlight the role of NOD2-TLR2 crosstalk in the immunopathogenesis of colitis.",

        "Abstract": "Increased apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is a significant cause of intestinal barrier dysfunction in Crohn's disease (CD). Sophoricoside (SOP) is an isoflavone glycoside known for its anti-apoptotic properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of SOP on mice with CD-like colitis and to understand the underlying mechanisms. Mice treated with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) were used to examine the therapeutic effect of SOP on CD-like colitis and intestinal barrier damage. To further explore SOP's impact on IECs apoptosis and intestinal barrier protection, an in vitro colonic organoid apoptosis model induced by TNF-\u03b1 was utilized. Network pharmacology was employed to predict the relevant pathways and molecular processes associated with SOP in the treatment of CD. Treatment with SOP significantly improved colitis symptoms in TNBS mice, as demonstrated by reductions in the Disease Activity Index (DAI), weight loss, colon shortening, macroscopic scores, colonic tissue inflammatory scores, and the expression of pro-inflammatory factors. Our experiments confirmed that SOP protects the intestinal barrier by counteracting IECs apoptosis. Additionally, this study established that SOP reduced IECs apoptosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. SOP can reduce IECs apoptosis through the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby protecting the intestinal barrier. This study is the first to illustrate how SOP ameliorates colitis and protects the intestinal barrier, suggesting SOP has potential clinical application in treating CD.",

        "Title": "<i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and <i>Parabacteroides distasonis</i> synergistically protect from colitis by promoting ILC3 in the gut.",
        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. The etiology of IBD remains elusive, but the disease is suggested to arise from the interaction of environmental and genetic factors that trigger inadequate immune responses and inflammation in the intestine. The gut microbiome majorly contributes to disease as an environmental variable, and although some causative bacteria are identified, little is known about which specific members of the microbiome aid in the intestinal epithelial barrier function to protect from disease. While chemically inducing colitis in mice from two distinct animal facilities, we serendipitously found that mice in one facility showed remarkable resistance to disease development, which was associated with increased markers of epithelial barrier integrity. Importantly, we show that <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and <i>Parabacteroides distasonis</i> were significantly increased in the microbiota of resistant mice. To causally connect these microbes to protection against disease, we colonized susceptible mice with the two bacterial species. Our results demonstrate that <i>A. muciniphila</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>distasonis</i> synergistically drive a protective effect in both acute and chronic models of colitis by boosting the frequency of type 3 innate lymphoid cells in the colon and by improving gut epithelial integrity. Altogether, our work reveals a combined effort of commensal microbes in offering protection against severe intestinal inflammation by shaping gut immunity and by enhancing intestinal epithelial barrier stability. Our study highlights the beneficial role of gut bacteria in dictating intestinal homeostasis, which is an important step toward employing microbiome-driven therapeutic approaches for IBD clinical management. The contribution of the gut microbiome to the balance between homeostasis and inflammation is widely known. Nevertheless, the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease, which is known to be influenced by genetics, immune response, and environmental cues, remains unclear. Unlocking novel players involved in the dictation of a protective gut, namely, in the microbiota component, is therefore crucial to develop novel strategies to tackle IBD. Herein, we revealed a synergistic interaction between two commensal bacterial strains, <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and <i>Parabacteroides distasonis</i>, which induce protection against both acute and chronic models of colitis induction, by enhancing epithelial barrier integrity and promoting group 3 innate lymphoid cells in the colonic mucosa. This study provides a novel insight on how commensal bacteria can beneficially act to promote intestinal homeostasis, which may open new avenues toward the use of microbiome-derived strategies to tackle IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Tolerogenic dendritic cells (TolDCs) have been evidenced to trigger regulatory T cell's (Treg's) differentiation and be involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) plays a crucial role in the differentiation of TolDCs, although the mechanism remains vague. This study aimed to evaluate the role of AhR in TolDCs formation, which may affect Th17/Treg balance in CD. Colon biopsy specimens were obtained from healthy controls and patients with CD. Wild type (WT) and AhR-/- mice were induced colitis by drinking dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) with or without 6-formylindolo 3,2-b carbazole (FICZ) treatment. Wild type and AhR-/- bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) were cultured under TolDCs polarization condition. Ratios of DCs surface markers were determined by flow cytometry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to quantify the levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and IL-10. Tolerogenic dendritic cells differentiated from BMDCs of WT or AhR-/- mice were adoptively transferred to DSS-induced WT colitis mice. Patients with CD showed less AhR expression and activation in their inflamed colon regions. Compared with WT mice, AhR-/- mice experienced more severe colitis. Tolerogenic dendritic cells and Tregs were both decreased in the colon of AhR-/- colitis mice, while Th17 cells were upregulated. In vitro, compared with WT DCs, AhR-deficient DCs led to less TolDC formation. Furthermore, intestinal inflammation in WT colitis mice, which transferred with AhR-/- TolDCs, showed no obvious improvement compared with those transferred with WT TolDCs, as evidenced by no rescues of Th17/Treg balance. Activation of AhR attenuates experimental colitis by modulating the balance of TolDCs and Th17/Treg. The AhR modulation of TolDCs may be a viable therapeutic approach for CD.",

        "Abstract": "The presence of myenteric plexitis in the proximal resection margins is a predictive factor of early postoperative recurrence in Crohn's disease. To decipher the mechanisms leading to their formation, T-cell interactions with enteric neural cells were studied in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. T cells close to myenteric neural cells were retrospectively quantified in ileocolonic resections from 9 control subjects with cancer and 20 patients with Crohn's disease. The mechanisms involved in T-cell adhesion were then investigated in co-cultures of T lymphocytes with enteric glial cells (glia). Finally, the implication of adhesion molecules in the development of plexitis and colitis was studied in\u00a0vitro but also in\u00a0vivo in Winnie mice. The mean number of T cells close to glia, but not neurons, was significantly higher in the myenteric ganglia of relapsing patients with Crohn's disease (2.42 \u00b1 0.5) as compared with controls (0.36 \u00b1 0.08, P\u00a0= .0007). Co-culture experiments showed that exposure to proinflammatory cytokines enhanced T-cell adhesion to glia and increased intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in glia. We next demonstrated that T-cell adhesion to glia was inhibited by an anti-ICAM-1 antibody. Finally, using the Winnie mouse model of colitis, we showed that the blockage of ICAM-1/lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) with lifitegrast reduced colitis severity and decreased T-cell infiltration in the myenteric plexus. Our present work argues for a role of glia-T-cell interaction in the development of myenteric plexitis through the adhesion molecules ICAM-1/LFA-1 and suggests that deciphering the functional consequences of glia-T-cell interaction is important to understand the mechanisms implicated in the development and recurrence of Crohn's disease.",

By analyzing metagenomic samples from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohorts, we identified multiple invertible regions where a particular orientation correlated with disease. These include the promoter of polysaccharide A (PSA) of Bacteroides fragilis, which induces regulatory T\u00a0cells (Tregs) and ameliorates experimental colitis. The PSA promoter was mostly oriented \"OFF\" in IBD patients, which correlated with increased B.\u00a0fragilis-associated bacteriophages. Similarly, in mice colonized with a healthy human microbiota and B.\u00a0fragilis, induction of colitis caused a decline of PSA in the \"ON\" orientation that reversed as inflammation resolved. Monocolonization of mice with B.\u00a0fragilis revealed that bacteriophage infection increased the frequency of PSA in the \"OFF\" orientation, causing reduced PSA expression and decreased Treg cells. Altogether, we reveal dynamic bacterial phase variations driven by bacteriophages and host inflammation, signifying bacterial functional plasticity during disease.",

New evidence suggests a role of IL-9-secreting Th9 cells in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC), although the molecular pathways through which IL-9 and Th9 cells may mediate intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD) are still unclear. We investigated the role of DR3 signaling in the differentiation of Th9 cells in mouse models of CD-like ileitis and colitis, including SAMP1/YitFc (SAMP) mice. Polarized-Th9 cells with functional DR3 from SAMP WT (Th9WT) harbor a pro-inflammatory signature compared to DR3-deficient Th9 cells that were obtained from DR3-/-xSAMP mice (Th9KO). Conversely, ablation of DR3 signaling generated anti-inflammatory responses, as reflected by higher numbers of IL-10 producing cells in DR3-/-xSAMP mice. Additionally, RNA-seq and phosphoproteomic analyses showed that inflammatory pathways are significantly more activated in Th9WT than in Th9KO cells. Finally, in the T-cell adoptive transfer model, Th9KO cells were less colitogenic than Th9WT, while IL-9 blockade diminished the severity of intestinal inflammation, indicating a crucial role of functional DR3 receptor in Th9 cells pathogenicity. We describe herein that a functional DR3 receptor is required for the pathogenicity of Th9 cells, thus, constituting a novel mechanism by which TL1A/DR3 signaling mediates experimental CD-like ileitis. The TL1A/DR3/Th9 pro-inflammatory pathway may offer a novel therapeutic target for patients with CD.",

In non-inflamed CD ileum, reduced MUC17 levels correlated with a compromised glycocalyx, allowing bacterial contact with enterocytes. <i>Muc17</i> deletion in mice rendered the small intestine prone to atypical infection while maintaining resistance to colitis. The loss of Muc17 resulted in spontaneous deterioration of epithelial homeostasis and extra-intestinal translocation of bacteria.

Crohn's disease (CD) is an IBD subtype with extensive mucosal inflammation, yet the mucosal virome, an empirical modulator of the bacteriome and mucosal immunity, remains largely unclear regarding its composition and role. Here, we exploited trans-cohort CD patients and healthy individuals to compositionally and functionally investigate the small bowel (terminal ileum) virome and bacteriome. The CD ileal virome was characterised by an under-representation of both lytic and temperate bacteriophages (especially those targeting bacterial pathogens), particularly in patients with flare-up. Meanwhile, the virome-bacteriome ecology in CD ileal mucosa was featured by a lack of Bifidobacterium- and Lachnospiraceae-led mutualistic interactions between bacteria and bacteriophages; surprisingly it was more pronounced in CD remission than flare-up, underlining the refractory and recurrent nature of mucosal inflammation in CD. Lastly, we substantiated that ileal virions from CD patients causally exacerbated intestinal inflammation in IBD mouse models, by reshaping a gut virome-bacteriome ecology preceding intestinal inflammation (microbial trigger) and augmenting microbial sensing/defence pathways in the intestine cells (host response). Altogether, our results highlight the significance of mucosal virome in CD pathogenesis and importance of mucosal virome restoration in CD therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory gut disorder. Molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical heterogeneity of CD remain poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gut physiology, and several have been implicated in the pathogenesis of adult CD. However, there is a dearth of large-scale miRNA studies for pediatric CD. We hypothesized that specific miRNAs uniquely mark pediatric CD. We performed small RNA-Seq of patient-matched colon and ileum biopsies from treatment-naive pediatric patients with CD (n = 169) and a control cohort (n = 108). Comprehensive miRNA analysis revealed 58 miRNAs altered in pediatric CD. Notably, multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that index levels of ileal miR-29 are strongly predictive of severe inflammation and stricturing. Transcriptomic analyses of transgenic mice overexpressing miR-29 show a significant reduction of the tight junction protein gene Pmp22 and classic Paneth cell markers. The dramatic loss of Paneth cells was confirmed by histologic assays. Moreover, we found that pediatric patients with CD with elevated miR-29 exhibit significantly lower Paneth cell counts, increased inflammation scores, and reduced levels of PMP22. These findings strongly indicate that miR-29 upregulation is a distinguishing feature of pediatric CD, highly predictive of severe phenotypes, and associated with inflammation and Paneth cell loss.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory gut disorders, majorly classified as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The complex, multifactorial etiopathogenesis of IBD involves genetic predisposition, environmental cues, aberrant mucosal immune response and a disturbed gut microbiota. Epidemiological trends, studies in gnotobiotic mice models and genome-wide association studies, identifying genes involved in microbial handling, together mount evidence in support of the gut microbiota playing a pivotal role in IBD pathogenesis. Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are characterized by severe dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, marked by an expansion of detrimental taxa and concomitant depletion of beneficial members. IBD is characterized by reduction in abundances of bacterial genera involved in production of short-chain fatty acids, bio-transformations of bile acids and synthesis of indole-based tryptophan compounds such as Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Coprococcus, Dorea, Parabacteroides, Eubacterium, Oscillibacter and Prevotella and elevation in members of phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. This imbalance not only results in exaggerated immune signaling towards the microbial antigens, but also results in an altered metabolomic milieu that triggers additional inflammatory cascades. The present review provides insights into the bacterial dysbiosis observed across different intestinal sites and their metabolomic imprints participating in IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Ketogenesis is considered to occur primarily in liver to generate ketones as an alternative energy source for non-hepatic tissues when glucose availability/utilization is impaired. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase-2 (HMGCS2) mediates the rate-limiting step in this mitochondrial pathway. Publicly available databases show marked down-regulation of HMGCS2 in colonic tissues in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This led us to investigate the expression and function of this pathway in colon and its relevance to colonic inflammation in mice. Hmgcs2 is expressed in cecum and colon. As global deletion of Hmgcs2 showed significant postnatal mortality, we used a conditional knockout mouse with enzyme deletion restricted to intestinal tract. These mice had no postnatal mortality. Fasting blood ketones were lower in these mice, indicating contribution of colonic ketogenesis to circulating ketones. There was also evidence of gut barrier breakdown and increased susceptibility to experimental colitis with associated elevated levels of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 in circulation. Interestingly, many of these phenomena were mostly evident in male mice. Hmgcs2 expression in colon is controlled by colonic microbiota as evidenced from decreased expression in germ-free mice and antibiotic-treated conventional mice and from increased expression in a human colonic epithelial cell line upon treatment with aqueous extracts of cecal contents. Transcriptomic analysis of colonic epithelia from control mice and Hmgcs2-null mice indicated an essential role for colonic ketogenesis in the maintenance of optimal mitochondrial function, cholesterol homeostasis, and cell-cell tight-junction organization. These findings demonstrate a sex-dependent obligatory role for ketogenesis in protection against colonic inflammation in mice.",

However, the bacterial strains directly involved in this regulation and their related metabolites are largely unknown. We sought to investigate the effects of intestinal microbial metabolites on intestinal epithelium and to elucidate their therapeutic potential in regulating intestinal mucosal inflammation and immune homeostasis. Here, we used metagenomic data from Crohn's disease (CD) patients to analyze the composition of intestinal flora and identify metabolite profiles associated with disease behavior, and used the mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis to characterize the therapeutic effects of the flora metabolite acetyl l-carnitine (ALC) on DSS-induced colitis. We found that intraperitoneal injection of ALC treatment could significantly alleviate the symptoms of DSS-induced colitis in mice, including prevention of weight loss, reduction in disease activity index (DAI) scores, increasing of colonic length, reduction in histological scores, and improvement in intestinal barrier function. Further, transcriptome sequencing analysis and gene silencing experiments revealed that the absence of CADM2 abolished the inhibitory effect of ALC on the TLR-MyD88 pathway in colonic epithelial cells, thereby reducing the release of inflammatory factors in colon epithelial cells. And we confirmed a significant downregulation of CADM2 expression in intestinal tissues of CD patients compared to healthy people in a population cohort. In addition, we also found that ALC increased the ratio of Treg cells in colon, and decreased the ratio of Th17 cells and macrophages, thereby improving the immune tolerance of the organism. The proposed study could be a potential approach for the treatment of CD.",

Here we investigate the intestinal function of ATP8B1 in relation to inflammatory bowel diseases. ATP8B1 expression was investigated in intestinal samples of patients with Crohn's Disease (CD) or Ulcerative Colitis (UC) as well as in murine models of intestinal inflammation. Colitis was induced in ATP8B1-deficient mice with Dextran Sodium Sulphate (DSS) and intestinal permeability was investigated. Epithelial barrier function was assessed in ATP8B1 knock-down Caco2-BBE cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in Caco2-BBE cells overexpressing ATP8B1-eGFP. Expression and localization of ATP8B1 and tight junction proteins were investigated in cells and in biopsies of UC and PFIC1 patients. ATP8B1 expression was decreased in UC and DSS-treated mice, and associated with a decreased Tight Junctional pathway transcriptional program. ATP8B1-deficient mice were extremely sensisitve to DSS-induced colitis, evidenced by increased intestinal barrier leakage. ATP8B1 knockdown cells showed delayed barrier establishment that associated with affected Claudin-4 (CLDN4) levels and localization.. CLDN4 immunohistochemistry showed a tight-junctional staining in control tissue, whereas in UC and intestinal PFIC1 samples, CLDN4 was not properly localized. ATP8B1 is important in the establishment of the intestinal barrier Downregulation of ATP8B1 levels in UC, and subsequent altered localization of tight junctional proteins, including CLDN4, might therefore be an important mechanism in UC pathophysiology.",

Detailed in silico analysis in human intestinal biopsies showed that <i>FPR1</i> is highly expressed in IBD (<i>n</i>\u2005=\u2005207 IBD vs 67 non-IBD controls, <i>P</i>\u2005<\u2005.001), and highly correlated with gut inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) (both <i>P</i>\u2005<\u2005.001). FPR1 receptor is predominantly expressed in leukocytes, and we showed significantly higher FPR1+ve neutrophils in inflamed gut tissue section in IBD (17 CD and 24 UC; both <i>P</i>\u2005<\u2005.001). Further analysis in 6 independent IBD (data available under Gene Expression Omnibus accession numbers GSE59071, GSE206285, GSE73661, GSE16879, GSE92415, and GSE235970) showed an association with active gut inflammation and treatment resistance to infliximab, ustekinumab, and vedolizumab. <i>FPR1</i> gene deletion is protective in murine DSS colitis with lower gut neutrophil inflammation. In the human ex vivo neutrophil system, mitochondrial FP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit-6 (ND6) is a potent activator of neutrophils resulting in higher CD62L shedding, CD63 expression, reactive oxygen species production, and chemotactic capacity; these effects are inhibited by cyclosporin H. We screened for mitochondrial ND6 in IBD (<i>n</i>\u2005=\u200554) using ELISA and detected ND6 in stools with median values of 2.2 gg/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 0.0-4.99; range 0-53.3) but not in blood. Stool ND6 levels, however, were not significantly correlated with paired stool calprotectin, C-reactive protein, and clinical IBD activity. Our data suggest that FPR1-mediated neutrophilic inflammation is a tractable target in IBD; however, further work is required to clarify the clinical utility of mitochondrial FPs as a potential mechanistic marker for future stratification.",

        "Title": "Sargramostim for Prophylactic Management of Gastrointestinal Immune-Related Adverse Events of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy for Cancer.",
        "Abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy improves outcomes in several cancers. Unfortunately, many patients experience grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events, including gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities which are common. These GI immune-related adverse events (irAEs) induced by ICIs present significant clinical challenges, require prompt intervention, and result in treatment delays or discontinuations. The treatment for these potentially severe and even fatal GI irAEs which include enterocolitis, severe diarrhea, and hepatitis may interfere with the anti-cancer approach. Sargramostim (glycosylated, yeast-derived, recombinant human GM-CSF) is an agent that has been used in clinical practice for more than 30 years with a well-recognized safety profile and has been studied in many therapeutic areas. The mechanism of action of sargramostim may treat moderate-to-severe GI irAEs without impairing the anti-cancer therapy. Some early data also suggest a potential survival benefit. Through the differentiation/maturation of monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils and induction of anti-inflammatory T cell responses, GM-CSF aids in GI homeostasis, mucosal healing, and mucosal immunity. GM-CSF knockout mice are susceptible to severe colitis which was prevented with murine GM-CSF administration. For some patients with GI mucosa and immune cell function impairment, e.g., Crohn's disease, sargramostim reduces disease severity. In a prospective, randomized study (ECOG 1608), advanced melanoma patients had a reduction in grade 3-5 GI irAEs and less frequent colonic perforation in the sargramostim plus ipilimumab arm compared to ipilimumab alone. Sargramostim continues to be studied with ICIs for the prophylactic management of irAEs while also potentially providing a survival benefit.",

        "Abstract": "Inappropriate immune activity is key in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, and it is typically driven by excess inflammation and/or autoimmunity. IL-1 is often the effector owing to its powerful role in both innate and adaptive immunity, and, thus, it is tightly controlled at multiple levels. IL-1R2 antagonizes IL-1, but effects of losing this regulation are unknown. We found that IL-1R2 resolves inflammation by rapidly scavenging free IL-1. Specific IL-1R2 loss in germinal center (GC) T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells increased the GC response after a first, but not booster, immunization, with an increase in T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, GC B cells, and antigen-specific antibodies, which was reversed upon IL-1 blockade. However, IL-1 signaling is not obligate for GC reactions, as WT and Il1r1-/- mice showed equivalent phenotypes, suggesting that GC IL-1 is normally restrained by IL-1R2. Fascinatingly, germline Il1r2-/- mice did not show this phenotype, but conditional Il1r2 deletion in adulthood recapitulated it, implying that compensation during development counteracts IL-1R2 loss. Finally, patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease had lower serum IL-1R2. All together, we show that IL-1R2 controls important aspects of innate and adaptive immunity and that IL-1R2 level may contribute to human disease propensity and/or progression.",

        "Title": "Integrated multi-omics reveal gut microbiota-mediated bile acid metabolism alteration regulating immunotherapy responses to anti-\u03b14\u03b27-integrin in Crohn's disease.",
        "Abstract": "Gut microbiota and related metabolites are both crucial factors that significantly influence how individuals with Crohn's disease respond to immunotherapy. However, little is known about the interplay among gut microbiota, metabolites, Crohn's disease, and the response to anti-\u03b14\u03b27-integrin in current studies. Our research utilized 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid to induce colitis based on the humanized immune system mouse model and employed a combination of whole-genome shotgun metagenomics and non-targeted metabolomics to investigate immunotherapy responses. Additionally, clinical cases with Crohn's disease initiating anti-\u03b14\u03b27-integrin therapy were evaluated comprehensively. Particularly, 16S-rDNA gene high-throughput sequencing and targeted bile acid metabolomics were conducted at weeks 0, 14, and 54. We found that anti-\u03b14\u03b27-integrin therapy has shown significant potential for mitigating disease phenotypes in remission-achieving colitis mice. Microbial profiles demonstrated that not only microbial composition but also microbially encoded metabolic pathways could predict immunotherapy responses. Metabonomic signatures revealed that bile acid metabolism alteration, especially elevated secondary bile acids, was a determinant of immunotherapy responses. Especially, the remission mice significantly enriched the proportion of the beneficial <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Clostridium</i> genera, which were correlated with increased gastrointestinal levels of BAs involving lithocholic acid and deoxycholic acid. Moreover, most of the omics features observed in colitis mice were replicated in clinical cases. Notably, anti-\u03b14\u03b27 integrin provided sustained therapeutic benefits in clinical remitters during follow-up, and long-lasting remission was linked to persistent changes in the microbial-related bile acids. In conclusion, gut microbiota-mediated bile acid metabolism alteration could play a crucial role in regulating immunotherapy responses to anti-\u03b14\u03b27-integrin in Crohn's disease. Therefore, the identification of prognostic microbial signals facilitates the advancement of targeted probiotics that activate anti-inflammatory bile acid metabolic pathways, thereby improving immunotherapy responses. The integrated multi-omics established in our research provide valuable insights into potential mechanisms that impact treatment responses in complex diseases.",

        "Abstract": "As a common complication of Crohn's disease (CD), the mechanism underlying CD intestinal fibrosis remains unclear. Studies have shown that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step in the development of intestinal fibrosis in CD. It is currently known that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MSC-AS1 plays an important role in regulating the secretion of inflammatory mediators and EMT; however, its role in intestinal fibrosis remains unclear. MSC-AS1 was significantly upregulated in the CD intestinal tissue and intestinal tissue of mice treated with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. Downregulation of its expression can inhibit EMT and alleviates intestinal fibrosis by regulating SNIP1. In addition, MSC-AS1 directly interacted with SENP1, blocking the deSUMOylation of SNIP1 and inhibiting its activity. Furthermore, we found that SENP1 enhanced the expression of SNIP1 and reduced intestinal fibrosis. In summary, MSC-AS1 regulates EMT through the SENP1/SNIP1 axis to promote fibrosis, and may be considered a potential molecular target for the treatment of CD and intestinal fibrosis.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) involves activation of mast cells (MC) and NF-\u043aB in parallel with the PPAR-\u03b1/NLRP3 inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 pathway in the inflamed colon. Whether polyphenols from maqui (<i>Aristotelia chilensis</i>) represent a natural alternative treatment for CD is unclear. Therefore, we used an animal model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced CD-like colitis to investigate protective effects of maqui extract through monitoring NLRP3 inflammasome and MC activation in colon tissue. Maqui extract was administered via orogastric route to mice after (post-Treatment group) or prior (pre-Treatment group) to TNBS-induction. Colon pathology was characterized by histoarchitectural imaging, disease activity index (DAI), and assessing NF-\u043aB, p-NF-\u043aB, PPAR-\u03b1/NLRP3 expression and IL-1\u03b2 levels. Compared to mice treated with TNBS alone administration of anthocyanin-rich maqui extract improved the DAI, colon histoarchitecture and reduced both colon wet-weight and transmural inflammation. Induction with TNBS significantly increased colonic NLPR3 inflammasome activation, while co-treatment with maqui extract (either post- or pre-Treatment) significantly downregulated NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 levels, which manifested as reduced colonic IL-1\u03b2 levels. Supplemented maqui extract marginally diminished NF-\u043aB activity in epithelial cells but reached statistical significance in immune cells (as judged by decreased NF-\u043aB phosphorylation). PPAR-\u03b1 signaling was largely unaffected by Maqui whereas MC infiltration into the colon mucosa and submucosa decreased and their level of degranulation was suppressed. These outcomes show the post- and pre- Treatment effect of a polyphenolic extract rich in anthocyanins from maqui the acute phase of TNBS- induced CD-like colitis is linked to suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome and reduced MC responses. These data indicate that maqui extract represents a potential nutraceutical for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",

This study evaluated the effects of the recombinants and excretory-secretory proteins of the Fasciola hepatica on induced colitis in Balb/c mice. The F. hepatica Recombinant proteins, Cathepsin L1 and Peroxiredoxin, and E/S proteins were intraperitoneally injected into the three mice groups as the case groups, while the control groups received PBS. Colitis was induced in mice by intraluminal administration of the 2, 4, 6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid solution (TNBS). After 8\u2009h, the case groups received the second dosage of the treatments, and it was repeated 24\u2009h later. The immunological, pathological, and macroscopic changes were evaluated 3\u2009days after colitis induction. The macroscopic evaluation revealed significantly lower inflammatory scores in the mice treated with recombinant Peroxiredoxin (rPRX) and recombinant Cathepsin L1 (rCL1). Despite the macroscopic observation, the pathological finding was insignificant between the groups. IFN-\u03b3 secretion was significantly lower in splenocytes of the groups that received rPRX, rCL1, and E/S than the controls. IL-10 showed significantly higher levels in groups treated with rPRX and rCL1 than controls, whereas the level of IL-4 was not statistically significant. Excretory-secretory proteins of the F. hepatica showed immunomodulatory potency and the main effects observed in this study were through the reduction of inflammatory cytokine and inflammation manifestation as well as induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines.",

        "Abstract": "The dysregulation of the gut-brain axis in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases can cause neuro-psychological disturbances, but the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. The choroid plexus (CP) maintains brain homeostasis and nourishment through the secretion and clearance of cerebrospinal fluid. Recent research has demonstrated the existence of a CP vascular barrier in mice which is modulated during intestinal inflammation. This study investigates possible correlations between CP modifications and inflammatory activity in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). In this prospective study, 17 patients with CD underwent concomitant abdominal and brain 3\u00a0T MRI. The volume and permeability of CP were compared with levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin (FC), sMARIA and SES-CD scores. The CP volume was negatively correlated with CRP levels (R\u00a0=\u00a0-0.643, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.024) and FC (R\u00a0=\u00a0-0.571, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.050). DCE metrics normalized by CP volume were positively correlated with CRP (K-trans: R\u00a0=\u00a00.587, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.045; Vp: R\u00a0=\u00a00.706, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.010; T1: R\u00a0=\u00a00.699, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.011), and FC (Vp: R\u00a0=\u00a00.606, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.037). Inflammatory activity in patients with CD is associated with changes in CP volume and permeability, thus supporting the hypothesis that intestinal inflammation could affect the brain through the modulation of CP vascular barrier also in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue repair and regeneration in the gastrointestinal system are crucial for maintaining homeostasis, with the process relying on intricate cellular interactions and affected by micro- and macro-nutrients. Iron, essential for various biological functions, plays a dual role in tissue healing by potentially causing oxidative damage and participating in anti-inflammatory mechanisms, underscoring its complex relationship with inflammation and tissue repair. The study aimed to elucidate the role of low dietary iron in gastrointestinal tissue repair. We utilized quantitative iron measurements to assess iron levels in inflamed regions of patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. In addition, 3 mouse models of gastrointestinal injury/repair (dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, radiation injury, and wound biopsy) were used to assess the effects of low dietary iron on tissue repair. We found that levels of iron in inflamed regions of both patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are elevated. Similarly, during gastrointestinal repair, iron levels were found to be heightened, specifically in intestinal epithelial cells across the 3 injury/repair models. Mice on a low-iron diet showed compromised tissue repair with reduced proliferation. In standard diet, epithelial cells and the stem cell compartment maintain adequate iron stores. However, during a period of iron deficiency, epithelial cells exhaust their iron reserves, whereas the stem cell compartments maintain their iron pools. During injury, when the stem compartment is disrupted, low iron levels impair proliferation and compromise repair mechanisms. Low dietary iron impairs intestinal repair through compromising the ability of epithelial cells to aid in intestinal proliferation.",

        "Abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells are suggested to play a critical role in the Crohn's Disease (CD) associated fibrosis. MAPKAPK2 (MK2) has emerged as a potential therapeutic target to reduce inflammation in CD. However, cell-specific pattern of pMK2 activation and its role in the CD associated fibrosis are unknown. The objectives of this study were to evaluate cell-specific changes in MK2 activity between predominantly inflammatory CD versus CD with fibrotic complication and define the role of stromal cell-specific MK2 activation in CD-associated fibrosis. CD tissue, CD tissue derived mesenchymal stromal cells known as myo-/fibroblasts (CD-MFs), fibroblast specific MK2 conditional KO mice were used. We observed that in the inflamed area of predominantly inflammatory CD, high MK2 activity was equally distributed between mesenchymal and hematopoietic cells. By contrast, in CD with fibrotic complications, high MK2 activity was mostly associated with mesenchymal stromal cells. Using ex vivo CD tissue explants and IL-10KO murine colitis model, we demonstrated that pro-fibrotic responses are significantly reduced by treatment with the MK2 inhibitor PF-3644022. Inhibition of MK2 activity in primary cultures of CD-MFs significantly reduced basal and TGF-\u03b21-induced profibrotic responses. Using fibroblast-specific MK2 knockout mice in chronic DSS colitis, we demonstrated that fibroblast intrinsic MK2 signaling is among the key processes involved in the chronic inflammation induced profibrotic responses. Our data suggest that activation of MK2 within fibroblasts contributes to the chronic inflammation induced fibrosis in CD and that targeting MK2 has potential for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for fibrosis in CD.",

However, the underlying mechanisms by which EEN reduces intestinal inflammation are currently unclear. The therapeutic potential of enteral nutrition (EN) was assessed using various mouse models. Fecal full-length 16S rDNA sequencing analysis and several CD metagenome datasets were used to identify the candidate therapeutic bacteria Faecalibaculum rodentium (F.\u00a0rodentium). Whole genome sequencing of F.\u00a0rodentium and widely-targeted metabolome analysis of the supernatant showed that EN-induced F.\u00a0rodentium accumulation protected against colitis via histidine biosynthesis. The therapeutic potential of EN therapy was observed in both dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and Il10<sup>-/-</sup> spontaneous colitis mouse models. Accumulation of F.\u00a0rodentium after EN therapy was determined using full-length 16S rDNA sequencing and verified with several metagenome datasets from patients with CD. Colonization of an isolated F.\u00a0rodentium could reduce colitis in Il10<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Significant histidine enrichment was observed in the F.\u00a0rodentium culture supernatant, and a series of histidine biosynthesis genes were observed in the F.\u00a0rodentium genome. Engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), encoding the heterologous hisG of F.\u00a0rodentium (EcN-hisG), which was a key driver of histidine biosynthesis in F.\u00a0rodentium, was found to protect against colitis.

JD is considered a priority under the One Health approach to prevent the spread of the causative agent to humans. Environmental screening is a strategic approach aimed at identifying dairy herds with animals infected with MAP. It serves as the initial step toward implementing more intensive actions to control the disease. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technology is widely used for diagnosis. Given that genome sequencing is now much more accessible than ever before, it is possible to target regions of the MAP genome that allow for the greatest diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. The aim of this study was to identify among the published qPCR assays targeting IS900 the more cost-effective options to detect MAP and to validate them in the diagnostic context of JD disease. MAP IS900 is a prime target because it is a multicopy genetic element. A total of 136 publications have reported on the use of IS900 qPCR assays over the past 3 decades. Among these records, 29 used the SYBR Green chemistry and TaqMan technology was used in 107 reports. Aside from the 9 reports using commercial assays, 72 TaqMan reports cited previously published work, leaving us with 27 TaqMan qPCR designs. Upon closer examination, 5 TaqMan designs contained mismatches in primer or probe sequences. Additionally, others exhibited high similarity to environmental microorganisms or non-MAP mycobacteria. We assessed the performance of 6 IS900 qPCR designs and their sensitivity when applied to clinical or environmental samples, which varied from 4 to 56 fold overall. Additionally, we provide recommendations for testing clinical and environmental samples, as certain strategies used previously should be avoided due to poor qPCR design (e.g., the presence of mismatches) or a lack of specificity.",

        "Abstract": "Previous reports have shown that preventing excessive intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis is a crucial approach for protecting the intestinal barrier in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Magnolin (MGL) has various biological activities, including antiapoptotic activities, but its role in CD has largely not been determined. This study investigated how MGL impacts CD-like colitis and the underlying mechanism involved. Mice were treated with TNBS to establish a disease model, and these mice were used to assess the therapeutic effects of MGL on CD-like colitis. TNF-\u03b1-treated colon organoids were used to evaluate the impact of MGL on intestinal barrier function and IEC apoptosis. Enrichment analysis was performed to examine the potential pathways through which MGL inhibits IEC apoptosis. Finally, rescue experiments showed the mechanism by which MGL suppresses IEC apoptosis. The animal experiments demonstrated that MGL treatment alleviated the weight loss, colon shortening, elevated disease activity index (DAI) scores, increased colitis histological scores and upregulated inflammatory factor expression that were observed in model mice. MGL ameliorated intestinal barrier dysfunction and the loss of tight junction (TJ) proteins (ZO-1 and Claudin-1) by inhibiting IEC apoptosis in both TNBS-treated mice and TNF-\u03b1-treated colon organoids. MGL inhibited the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, thus safeguarding the intestinal barrier and alleviating CD-like colitis in vivo and in vitro. MGL improves the intestinal barrier integrity and prevents CD-like colitis by inhibiting IEC apoptosis. The potential mechanism of its anti-apoptotic impact on IECs could be associated with the PI3K/AKT pathway, presenting novel approaches and avenues for the clinical management of CD.",

        "Title": "Carrageenan as a Potential Factor of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.",
        "Abstract": "Carrageenan is a widely used food additive and is seen as a potential candidate in the pharmaceutical industry. However, there are two faces to carrageenan that allows it to be used positively for therapeutic purposes. Carrageenan can be used to create edible films and for encapsulating drugs, and there is also interest in the use of carrageenan for food printing. Carrageenan is a naturally occurring polysaccharide gum. Depending on the type of carrageenan, it is used in regulating the composition of intestinal microflora, including the increase in the population of Bifidobacterium bacteria. On the other hand, the studies have demonstrated the harmfulness of carrageenan in animal and human models, indicating a direct link between diet and intestinal inflammatory states. Carrageenan changes the intestinal microflora, especially <i>Akkermansia muciniphilia</i>, degrades the mucous barrier and breaks down the mucous barrier, causing an inflammatory reaction. It directly affects epithelial cells by activating the pro-inflammatory nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) pathway. The mechanism is based on activation of the TLR4 receptor, alterations in macrophage activity, production of proinflammatory cytokines and activation of innate immune pathways. Carrageenan increases the content of Bacteroidetes bacteria, also causing a reduction in the number of short chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria. The result is damage to the integrity of the intestinal membrane and reduction of the mucin layer. The group most exposed to the harmful effects of carrageenan are people suffering from intestinal inflammation, including Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).",

        "Abstract": "To date, several members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels which provide a wide array of roles have been found in the gastrointestinal tract (GI). The goal of earlier research was to comprehend the intricate signaling cascades that contribute to TRP channel activation as well as how these receptors' activity affects other systems. Moreover, there is a large volume of published studies describing the role of TRP channels in a number of pathological disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and sepsis. Nevertheless, the generalizability of these results is subject to certain limitations. For instance, the study of IBD relies on various animal models and experimental methods, which are unable to precisely imitate the multifactorial chronic disease. The diverse pathophysiological mechanisms and unique susceptibility of animals may account for the inconsistency of the experimental data collected. The main purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive review and analysis of existing studies on transient receptor potential (TRP) channels implicating specific models of colitis and sepsis, with particular emphasis on their involvement in pathological disorders such as IBD and sepsis. Furthermore, the text endeavors to evaluate the generalizability of experimental findings, taking into consideration the limitations posed by animal models and experimental methodologies. Finally, we also provide an updated schematic of the most important and possible molecular signaling pathways associated with TRP channels in IBD and sepsis.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses a number of debilitating chronic gastrointestinal (GI) inflammatory disorders, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In both conditions, mucosal inflammation is a key clinical presentation and is associated with altered serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) signaling. This altered 5-HT signaling is also found across various animal models of colitis. Of the 14 known receptor subtypes, 5-HT receptor type 7 (5-HT<sub>7</sub>) is one of the most recently discovered. We previously reported that blocking 5-HT signaling, with either a selective 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor antagonist (SB-269970) or genetic ablation alleviated intestinal inflammation in murine experimental models of colitis. Here, we developed novel antagonists, namely MC-170073 and MC-230078, which target 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors with high selectivity. We also investigated the in vivo efficacy of these antagonists in experimental colitis by utilizing dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and the transfer of CD4+CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T cells to induce intestinal inflammation. Inhibition of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor signaling with the antagonists, MC-170073 and MC-230078, ameliorated intestinal inflammation in both acute and chronic colitis models, which was accompanied by lower histopathological damage and diminished levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in comparison to vehicle-treated controls. Together, the data reveal that the pharmacological inhibition of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors by these selective antagonists ameliorates the severity of colitis across various experimental models and may, in the future, serve as a potential treatment option for patients with IBD. In addition, these findings support that 5-HT<sub>7</sub> is a viable therapeutic target for IBD.",

To characterise the rectal and cutaneous microbiota in German shepherd dogs with perianal fistulas and to investigate longitudinal shifts with lesion resolution during immunomodulatory therapy. Eleven German shepherd dogs with perianal fistulas and 15 healthy German shepherd dogs. Affected dogs were evaluated and swabbed at three visits, 30\u2009days apart, while undergoing treatment with ciclosporin and ketoconazole. Healthy German shepherd dogs were contemporaneously sampled. Sites included the rectum, perianal skin and axilla. The microbiome was evaluated following sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Alpha diversity was not significantly different between healthy and affected dogs at each of the three body sites (p\u2009>\u20090.5), yet rectal and perianal beta diversities from affected dogs differed significantly from those of healthy dogs at Day 0 (p\u2009=\u20090.004). Rectal and perianal relative abundance of Prevotella spp. increased and perianal Staphylococcus spp. relative abundance decreased in affected dogs over time, coincident with lesion resolution. Changes in lesional cutaneous and rectal microbiota occur in German shepherd dogs with perianal fistulas and shift over time with lesion resolution during immunomodulatory therapy. Further investigations of the role of cutaneous and enteric microbiota in the pathogenesis of perianal fistulas, and whether manipulation of microbial populations may ameliorate disease, are needed.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease that affects the entire digestive tract. IBD can be classified as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. The key symptoms of IBD include the emergence of abscesses or pustules, pronounced abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, fistulas, and intestinal narrowing, all of which can greatly affect a patient's daily well-being. Several factors, including bacterial infections, immune response irregularities, and changes in the intestinal milieu, can contribute to the onset of IBD. The aim of this study was investigating the role of cirsimaritin in reducing the severity of colitis in animal model. To induce colitis in laboratory Swiss albino mice, a 4% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) concoction was provided in their hydration source for a duration of six days. Before the onset of colitis, mice were treated with cirsimaritin (10 mg/kg) once daily to evaluate its potential treatment effects against DSS-induced inflammation. The results showed that 10 mg/kg of cirsimaritin decreased colitis severity (<i>P</i><0.05). Moreover, cirsimaritin successfully reversed the detrimental effects induced by DSS, including weight reduction, colon truncation, tissue-related damage, increased levels of inflammatory cells in the affected region, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Our findings suggest that cirsimaritin can effectively alleviate acute colitis triggered by DSS.",

        "Abstract": "Commensal enteric bacteria have evolved systems that enable growth in the ecologic niche of the host gastrointestinal tract. Animals evolved parallel mechanisms to survive the constant exposure to bacteria and their metabolic by-products. We propose that drug transporters encompass a crucial system to managing the gut microbiome. Drug transporters are present in the apical surface of gut epithelia. They detoxify cells from small molecules and toxins (xenobiotics) in the lumen. Here, we review what is known about commensal structure in the absence of the transporter ABCB1/P-glycoprotein in mammalian models. Knockout or low-activity alleles of ABCB1 lead to dysbiosis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in mammals. However, the exact function of ABCB1 in these contexts remain unclear. We highlight emerging models-the zebrafish <i>Danio rerio</i> and sea urchin <i>Lytechinus pictus</i>-that are poised to help dissect the fundamental mechanisms of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in the tolerance of commensal and pathogenic communities in the gut. We and others hypothesize that ABCB1 plays a direct role in exporting inflammatory bacterial products from host epithelia. Interdisciplinary work in this research area will lend novel insight to the transporter-mediated pathways that impact microbiome community structure and accelerate the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease when perturbed.

        "Title": "<i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and <i>Parabacteroides distasonis</i> synergistically protect from colitis by promoting ILC3 in the gut.",
        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. The etiology of IBD remains elusive, but the disease is suggested to arise from the interaction of environmental and genetic factors that trigger inadequate immune responses and inflammation in the intestine. The gut microbiome majorly contributes to disease as an environmental variable, and although some causative bacteria are identified, little is known about which specific members of the microbiome aid in the intestinal epithelial barrier function to protect from disease. While chemically inducing colitis in mice from two distinct animal facilities, we serendipitously found that mice in one facility showed remarkable resistance to disease development, which was associated with increased markers of epithelial barrier integrity. Importantly, we show that <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and <i>Parabacteroides distasonis</i> were significantly increased in the microbiota of resistant mice. To causally connect these microbes to protection against disease, we colonized susceptible mice with the two bacterial species. Our results demonstrate that <i>A. muciniphila</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>distasonis</i> synergistically drive a protective effect in both acute and chronic models of colitis by boosting the frequency of type 3 innate lymphoid cells in the colon and by improving gut epithelial integrity. Altogether, our work reveals a combined effort of commensal microbes in offering protection against severe intestinal inflammation by shaping gut immunity and by enhancing intestinal epithelial barrier stability. Our study highlights the beneficial role of gut bacteria in dictating intestinal homeostasis, which is an important step toward employing microbiome-driven therapeutic approaches for IBD clinical management. The contribution of the gut microbiome to the balance between homeostasis and inflammation is widely known. Nevertheless, the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease, which is known to be influenced by genetics, immune response, and environmental cues, remains unclear. Unlocking novel players involved in the dictation of a protective gut, namely, in the microbiota component, is therefore crucial to develop novel strategies to tackle IBD. Herein, we revealed a synergistic interaction between two commensal bacterial strains, <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and <i>Parabacteroides distasonis</i>, which induce protection against both acute and chronic models of colitis induction, by enhancing epithelial barrier integrity and promoting group 3 innate lymphoid cells in the colonic mucosa. This study provides a novel insight on how commensal bacteria can beneficially act to promote intestinal homeostasis, which may open new avenues toward the use of microbiome-derived strategies to tackle IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic inflammatory condition of the human intestine, comprises Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). IBD causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms and increases the risk of developing colorectal carcinoma. Although the etiology of IBD remains ambiguous, complex interactions between genetic predisposition, microbiota, epithelial barrier, and immune factors have been implicated. The disruption of intestinal homeostasis is a cardinal characteristic of IBD. Patients with IBD exhibit intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, impaired epithelial tight junctions, and immune dysregulation; however, the relationship between them is not completely understood. As the largest body surface is exposed to the external environment, the gastrointestinal tract epithelium is continuously subjected to environmental and endogenous stressors that can disrupt cellular homeostasis and survival. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are endogenous factors that play crucial roles in various physiological processes, such as maintaining intestinal homeostasis and influencing IBD progression. Specifically, HSPs share an intricate association with microbes, intestinal epithelium, and the immune system. In this review, we aim to elucidate the impact of HSPs on IBD development by examining their involvement in the interactions between the intestinal microbiota, epithelial barrier, and immune system. The recent clinical and animal models and cellular research delineating the relationship between HSPs and IBD are summarized. Additionally, new perspectives on IBD treatment approaches have been proposed.",

However, it remains unclear whether the observations are causal because of confounding factors. To investigate the causal associations between urate levels and IBD using bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR). Independent genetic variants for urate levels and IBD were selected as instrumental variables from published genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Summary statistics for instrument-outcome associations were retrieved from three separate databases for IBD (the UK Biobank, the FinnGen database and a large GWAS meta-analysis) and one for urate levels (a large GWAS meta-analysis). MR analyses included the inverse-variance-weighted method, weighted-median estimator, MR-Egger and sensitivity analyses (MR-PRESSO). A meta-analysis was also conducted to merge the data from separate outcome databases using a fixed-effects model. Genetically higher serum urate levels were strongly associated with an increased risk of UC [odds ratio (OR): 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.86-2.05] after outlier correction, and the ORs (95%CIs) for IBD and CD were 0.94 (95%CI: 0.86-1.03) and 0.91 (95%CI: 0.80-1.04), respectively. Animal studies have confirmed the positive association between urate levels and UC. Moreover, genetically predicted IBD was inversely related to urate levels (OR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.94-0.99). However, no association was observed between genetically influenced UC or CD and urate levels.

However, the direction and causality of their interactions remain unclear. Thus, this study employs Mendelian Randomization to explore whether there are causal associations of genetically predicted PSC with IBD. Genetic variants associated with the genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PSC were used as instrumental variables. The statistics for IBD, including ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD) were derived from GWAS. Then, five methods were used to estimate the effects of genetically predicted PSC on IBD, including MR Egger, Weighted median (WM), Inverse variance weighted (IVW), Simple mode, and Weighted mode. Last, we also evaluated the pleiotropic effects, heterogeneity, and a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis that drives causal associations to confirm the validity of the analysis. Genetically predicted PSC was significantly associated with an increased risk of UC, according to the study (odds ratio [OR] IVW= 1.0014, P<0.05). However, none of the MR methods found significant causal evidence of genetically predicted PSC in CD (All P>0.05). The sensitivity analysis results showed that the causal effect estimations of genetically predicted PSC on IBD were robust, and there was no horizontal pleiotropy or statistical heterogeneity. Our study corroborated a causal association between genetically predicted PSC and UC but did not between genetically predicted PSC and CD.

Fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) PET/CT has emerged as a promising tool to assess fibrosis. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic capability of [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FAPI PET/CT in detecting intestinal fibrosis and compared it with[<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG PET/CT and magnetization transfer MR imaging (MTI). Twenty-two rats underwent TNBS treatment to simulate fibrosis development, followed by three quantitative imaging sessions within one week. Mean and maximum standardized uptake values (SUV<sub>mean</sub> and SUV<sub>max</sub>) were calculated on[<sup>18</sup>F]F-FAPI and [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG PET/CT, along with normalized magnetization transfer ratio on MTI. Intestinal fibrosis was assessed pathologically, with MTI serving as imaging standard for fibrosis. The diagnostic efficacy of imaging parameters in fibrosis was compared using pathological and imaging standards. Ten patients with 34 bowel strictures were prospectively recruited to validate their diagnostic performance, using the identical imaging protocol. In CD patients, the accuracy of FAPI uptake (both AUCs\u2009=\u20090.87, both P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01) in distinguishing non-to-mild from moderate-to-severe fibrosis was higher than FDG uptake (both AUCs\u2009=\u20090.82, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01) and comparable to MTI (AUCs\u2009=\u20090.90, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001).

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a family of chronic disorders along the gastrointestinal tract. Because of its idiopathic nature, IBD does not have a fundamental cure; current available therapies for IBD are limited to prolonged doses of immunomodulatory agents. While these treatments may reduce inflammation, limited therapeutic efficacy, inconsistency across patients, and adverse side effects from aggressive medications remain as major drawbacks. Recently, excessive production and accumulation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) also known as NETosis have been identified to exacerbate inflammatory responses and induce further tissue damage in IBD. Such discovery invited many researchers to investigate NETs as a potential therapeutic target. DNase-I is a natural agent that can effectively destroy NETs and, therefore, potentially reduce NETs-induced inflammations even without the use of aggressive drugs. However, low stability and rapid clearance of DNase-I remain as major limitations for further therapeutic applications. In this research, polymeric nanozymes were fabricated to increase the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of DNase-I. DNase-I was immobilized on the surface of polymeric nanoparticles to maintain its enzymatic properties while extending its activity in the colon. Delivery of DNase-I using this platform allowed enhanced stability and prolonged activity of DNase-I with minimal toxicity.

        "Abstract": "Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are effective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, this class of medications is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding based on animal data suggesting teratogenesis and recent reports of transmammary transfer after maternal ingestion, raising concerns for immune system development in babies exposed to these drugs. We present the case of a patient with IBD treated with a JAK inhibitor who decided to continue the medication throughout her pregnancy and during breastfeeding. This is the first reported case of a detailed immunologic profile in a baby exposed to tofacitinib in utero and during lactation. A 30-year-old female with ulcerative colitis with previous exposure to vedolizumab and infliximab achieved complete remission with tofacitinib therapy. The patient became pregnant after 5 months of JAK inhibitor therapy and decided to continue tofacitinib during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. The patient delivered a healthy offspring with no congenital malformations, a normal detailed immunologic profile, and subsequent safe provision of the live oral rotavirus vaccine. This case highlights the importance of individualized counseling for patients of childbearing age who are candidates for JAK inhibition. Those who are pregnant or breastfeeding with refractory disease may have limited medical therapeutic options. Ongoing effective therapy for IBD resulted in complete disease remission in the mother and favorable outcomes in the infant. Further, an in-depth infant immunological assessment can lead to specific vaccination recommendations in exposed infants.",

        "Abstract": "The rising incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), specifically in the developing world, suggests an important environmental effect. Amongst environmental influences, dietary factors, particularly the adoption of a westernized diet, have been specifically noticed. In contrast, the Mediterranean diet (MED), characterized by high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, olive oil, and moderate consumption of animal and ultra processed foods, has shown potential positive effects in IBD. Here we conducted a narrative review focusing on the evidence regarding the role of MED in IBD prevention and management. Epidemiological studies suggest inverse association of MED with CD development. Furthermore, adherence to MED has been associated with clinical improvement in active CD and maintenance of lower levels of inflammatory markers in UC, along with improved quality of life and lower mortality rates in IBD patients. Mechanistically, MED promotes a diverse and beneficial gut microbiota, possesses anti-inflammatory properties through polyphenols and dietary fats, and may modulate oxidative stress. In clinical practice, MED may be adapted to diverse disease phenotypes and cultural preferences, and is a sustainable, easy to maintain dietary approach. Current evidence may support the integration of MED into clinical practice in IBD care. In future research, the efficacy of MED in specific IBD phenotypes should be assessed.",

        "Abstract": "A pathogenic mutation in the manganese transporter ZIP8 (A391T; rs13107325) increases the risk of Crohn's disease. ZIP8 regulates manganese homeostasis and given the shared need for metals between the host and resident microbes, there has been significant interest in alterations of the microbiome in carriers of ZIP8 A391T. Prior studies have not examined the ileal microbiome despite associations between ileal disease and ZIP8 A391T. Here, we used the Pediatric Risk Stratification Study (RISK) \u00a0cohort to perform a secondary analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing data obtained from ileal and rectal mucosa to study associations between ZIP8 A391T carrier status and microbiota composition. We found sequence variants mapping to Veillonella were decreased in the ileal mucosa of ZIP8 A391T carriers. Prior human studies have demonstrated the sensitivity of Veillonella to bile acid abundance. We therefore hypothesized that bile acid homeostasis is differentially regulated in carriers of ZIP8 A391T. Using a mouse model of ZIP8 A391T, we demonstrate an increase in total bile acids in the liver and stool and decreased fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15) signaling, consistent with our hypothesis. We confirmed dysregulation of FGF19 in the 1000IBD cohort, finding that plasma FGF19 levels are lower in ZIP8 A391T carriers with ileocolonic Crohn's disease. In the search for genotype-specific therapeutic paradigms for patients with Crohn's disease, these data suggest targeting the FGF19 pathway in ZIP8 A391T carriers. Aberrant bile acid metabolism may precede development of Crohn's disease and prioritize study of the interactions between manganese homeostasis, bile acid metabolism and signaling, and complicated ileal Crohn's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) involves activation of mast cells (MC) and NF-\u043aB in parallel with the PPAR-\u03b1/NLRP3 inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 pathway in the inflamed colon. Whether polyphenols from maqui (<i>Aristotelia chilensis</i>) represent a natural alternative treatment for CD is unclear. Therefore, we used an animal model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced CD-like colitis to investigate protective effects of maqui extract through monitoring NLRP3 inflammasome and MC activation in colon tissue. Maqui extract was administered via orogastric route to mice after (post-Treatment group) or prior (pre-Treatment group) to TNBS-induction. Colon pathology was characterized by histoarchitectural imaging, disease activity index (DAI), and assessing NF-\u043aB, p-NF-\u043aB, PPAR-\u03b1/NLRP3 expression and IL-1\u03b2 levels. Compared to mice treated with TNBS alone administration of anthocyanin-rich maqui extract improved the DAI, colon histoarchitecture and reduced both colon wet-weight and transmural inflammation. Induction with TNBS significantly increased colonic NLPR3 inflammasome activation, while co-treatment with maqui extract (either post- or pre-Treatment) significantly downregulated NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 levels, which manifested as reduced colonic IL-1\u03b2 levels. Supplemented maqui extract marginally diminished NF-\u043aB activity in epithelial cells but reached statistical significance in immune cells (as judged by decreased NF-\u043aB phosphorylation). PPAR-\u03b1 signaling was largely unaffected by Maqui whereas MC infiltration into the colon mucosa and submucosa decreased and their level of degranulation was suppressed. These outcomes show the post- and pre- Treatment effect of a polyphenolic extract rich in anthocyanins from maqui the acute phase of TNBS- induced CD-like colitis is linked to suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome and reduced MC responses. These data indicate that maqui extract represents a potential nutraceutical for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a disease of chronic inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract due to disturbance of the inflammation and immune system. Symptoms of IBD include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bleeding, reduced weight, and fatigue. In IBD, the immune system attacks the intestinal tract's inner wall, causing chronic inflammation and tissue damage. In particular, interlukin-6 and interlukin-17 act on immune cells, including T cells and macrophages, to amplify the immune responses so that tissue damage and morphological changes occur. Of note, excessive calorie intake and obesity also affect the immune system due to inflammation caused by lipotoxicity and changes in lipids supply. Similarly, individuals with IBD have alterations in liver function after sustained high-fat diet feeding. In addition, excess dietary fat intake, along with alterations in primary and secondary bile acids in the colon, can affect the onset and progression of IBD because inflammatory cytokines contribute to insulin resistance; the factors include the release of inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and changes in intestinal microflora, which may also contribute to disease progression. However, interfering with de novo fatty acid synthase by deleting the enzyme acetyl-CoA-carboxylase 1 in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) leads to the deficiency of epithelial crypt structures and tissue regeneration, which seems to be due to Lgr5<sup>+</sup> intestinal stem cell function. Thus, conflicting reports exist regarding high-fat diet effects on IBD animal models. This review will focus on the pathological basis of the link between dietary lipids intake and IBD and will cover the currently available pharmacological approaches.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a lifelong problem for patients, despite having multiple pharmacological options and surgeries for\u00a0treatment. In order to achieve best results, probiotics are being used even though their efficacy is still debatable. This systematic review analyzes the safety and efficacy of several probiotics in CD. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect are the databases searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), animal studies, in vitro studies, and reviews. After quality appraisal and cross checking the literature, this systematic review is carried out grounded on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis 2020 (PRISMA 2020)\u00a0guidelines. A study of 16 papers in total which include nearly 2023 subjects\u00a0showed that\u00a0only very few probiotics are efficient in furnishing remission in CD complaints. Kefir, an inexpensive fermented milk product, significantly reduced the inflammation and drastically bettered the quality of life and hence can be considered as an asset for CD patients. <i>Lactobacillus thermophilus</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>, and <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i> can control diarrhea in patients of 22-54-year age group and improve cognitive reactivity in sad mood with short-term consumption. VSL#3 (VSL Pharmaceuticals,\u00a0Gaithersburg,\u00a0Maryland, United States) has good efficacy in precluding recurrence and easing side effects after ileocecal resection in adults. Animal models and lab studies have proved that <i>Lactobacillus plantarum CBT LP3</i>, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae\u00a0CNCM I-3856</i> (<i>yeast</i>), few strains of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> spp., <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus LA1</i>, <i>Lactobacillus paracasei 101/37</i>, and especially <i>Bifidobacterium breve Bbr8</i>\u00a0are significant enough to ameliorate the disease condition. In conclusion, probiotics are safe in CD with very few modifiable side effects. Some probiotics are proven to be significant in animal and lab studies; hence, these should be studied in human RCTs, to check their efficiency in human beings. There are limited observational and interventional studies in this regard. Large population-sizes trials are highly demanded in the\u00a0areas of prognosticated positive results that are mentioned in this systematic review.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and recurrent intestinal inflammatory disease, mainly including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In recent years, the incidence and prevalence of IBD have been on the rise worldwide and have become a significant concern of health and a huge economic burden on patients. The occurrence and development of IBD involve a variety of pathogenic factors. The changes in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are considered to be an important pathogenic mechanism of this disease. SCFAs are important metabolites in the intestinal microbial environment, which are closely involved in regulating immune, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammatory activities. Changes in metabolite levels can reflect the homeostasis of the intestinal microflora. Recent studies have shown that SCFAs provide energy for host cells and intestinal microflora, shape the intestinal environment, and regulate the immune system, thereby regulating intestinal physiology. SCFAs can effectively reduce the incidence of enteritis, cardiovascular disease, colon cancer, obesity, and diabetes, and also play an important role in maintaining the balance of energy metabolism (mainly glucose metabolism) and improving insulin tolerance. In recent years, many studies have shown that numerous decoctions and natural compounds of traditional Chinese medicine have shown promising therapeutic activities in multiple animal models of colitis and thus attracted increasing attention from scientists in the study of IBD treatment. Some of these traditional Chinese medicines or compounds can effectively alleviate colonic inflammation and clinical symptoms by regulating the generation of SCFAs. This study reviews the effects of various traditional Chinese medicines or bioactive substances on the production of SCFAs and their potential impacts on the severity of colonic inflammation. On this basis, we discussed the mechanism of SCFAs in regulating IBD-associated inflammation, as well as the related regulatory factors and signaling pathways. In addition, we provide our understanding of the limitations of current research and the prospects for future studies on the development of new IBD therapies by targeting SCFAs. This review may widen our understanding of the effect of traditional medicine from the view of SCFAs and their role in alleviating IBD animal models, thus contributing to the studies of IBD researchers.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is challenging to diagnose, and frequently relapses, significantly affecting patients' quality of life. Despite extensive efforts, the pathogenesis of IBD remains unclear. In this study, we integrated bioinformatics analysis and animal disease model to investigate IBD from two dimensions to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers and explore the pathogenesis of distinct conditions at tissue-specific levels. Firstly, we identified dysferlin (DYSF) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2) as crucial biomarkers for IBD, with 11 and 13 putative biomarkers for CD and UC, respectively, identified by peripheral blood testing only. CXCL8 and S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) were determined to be critical hub genes and validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Secondly, in CD, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly associated with immunity based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, while the metabolism of multiple substances and substance transport activity were dominant in UC. Thirdly, essential genes in the pathological progression of CD and UC were identified through protein-protein interaction networks and molecular complex detection (MCODE) analysis. Finally, pathological examination and quantitative analysis of IBD models confirmed the above results. Our findings could contribute to understanding the molecular mechanism of IBD, hold clinical significance for early diagnosis and prevention, and provide effective targets for treating IBD.",

The use of pre-clinical animal models has been invaluable for the understanding of potential disease mechanisms. However, despite promising results of numerous therapeutics in mouse colitis models, many of these therapies did not show clinical benefits in patients with IBD. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has recently revolutionized our understanding of complex interactions between the immune system, stromal cells, and epithelial cells by mapping novel cell subpopulations and their remodeling during disease. This technology has not been widely applied to pre-clinical models of IBD. ScRNA-seq profiling of murine models may provide an opportunity to increase the translatability into the clinic, and to choose the most appropriate model to test hypotheses and novel therapeutics. In this review, we have summarized some of the key findings at the single cell transcriptomic level in IBD, how specific signatures have been functionally validated <i>in vivo</i>, and highlighted the similarities and differences between scRNA-seq findings in human IBD and experimental mouse models. In each section of this review, we highlight the importance of utilizing this technology to find the most suitable or translational models of IBD based on the cellular therapeutic target.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by an overabundance of epithelial cell death and an imbalance in microflora, both of which contribute to the dysfunction of the intestinal barrier. Arjunolic acid (AA) has anti-apoptotic effects and regulates microbiota efficacy. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the treatment on colitis resembling Crohn's disease, along with exploring the potential underlying mechanism. CD animal models were created using Il-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice, and the impact of AA on colitis in mice was evaluated through disease activity index, weight fluctuations, pathological examination, and assessment of intestinal barrier function. To clarify the direct role of AA on intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis, organoids were induced by LPS, and TUNEL staining was performed. To investigate the potential mechanisms of AA in protecting the intestinal barrier, various methods including bioinformatics analysis and FMT experiments were employed. The treatment for AA enhanced the condition of colitis and the function of the intestinal barrier in Il-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice. This was demonstrated by the amelioration of weight loss, reduction in tissue inflammation score, and improvement in intestinal permeability. Moreover, AA suppressed the apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells in Il-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice and LPS-induced colon organoids, while also reducing the levels of Bax and C-caspase-3. In terms of mechanism, AA suppressed the activation of TLR4 signaling in Il-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice and colon organoids induced by LPS. In addition, AA increased the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria in the stool of Il-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice, and transplantation of feces from AA-treated mice improved CD-like colitis. The results of our study demonstrate that AA has a protective effect on the intestinal barrier in Crohn's disease-like colitis by preventing apoptosis. Additionally, this groundbreaking study reveals the capacity of AA to hinder TLR4 signaling and alter the makeup of the intestinal microbiome. The findings present fresh possibilities for treating individuals diagnosed with Crohn's disease. AA offers a hopeful novel strategy for managing Crohn's disease by obstructing crucial pathways implicated in intestinal inflammation and enhancing the gut microbiota.",

        "Abstract": "Colonic epithelial damage and dysregulated immune response are crucial factors in the progression and exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Nanoenabled targeted drug delivery to the inflamed intestinal mucosa has shown promise in inducing and maintaining colitis remission, while minimizing side effects. Inspired by the excellent antioxidative and anti-inflammatory efficacy of naturally derived magnolol (Mag) and gut homeostasis regulation of microbiota-derived butyrate, we developed a pH/redox dual-responsive butyrate-rich polymer nanoparticle (PSBA) as an oral Mag delivery system for combinational therapy of IBD. PSBA showed a high butyrate content of 22% and effectively encapsulated Mag. The Mag-loaded nanoparticles (PSBA@Mag) demonstrated colonic pH and reduction-responsive drug release, ensuring efficient retention and adhesion in the colon of colitis mice. PSBA@Mag not only normalized the level of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory effectors in inflamed colonic mucosa but also restored the epithelial barrier function in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease mouse models. Importantly, PSBA promoted the migration and healing ability of intestinal epithelial cells <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, sensitizing the therapeutic efficacy of Mag in animal models. Moreover, transcriptomics and metabolism analyses revealed that PSBA@Mag mitigated inflammation by suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and restoring the lipid metabolism. Additionally, this nanomedicine modulated the gut microbiota by inhibiting pathogenic <i>Proteus</i> and <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i> and promoting the proliferation of beneficial probiotics, including <i>Lachnoclostridium, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group</i> and <i>norank_f_Ruminococcaceae</i>.

Here we present reverse metabolomics as a discovery strategy, whereby tandem mass spectrometry spectra acquired from newly synthesized compounds are searched for in public metabolomics datasets to uncover phenotypic associations. To demonstrate the concept, we broadly synthesized and explored multiple classes of metabolites in humans, including N-acyl amides, fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids, bile acid esters and conjugated bile acids. Using repository-scale analysis<sup>1,2</sup>, we discovered that some conjugated bile acids are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Validation using four distinct human IBD cohorts showed that cholic acids conjugated to Glu, Ile/Leu, Phe, Thr, Trp or Tyr are increased in Crohn's disease. Several of these compounds and related structures affected pathways associated with IBD, such as interferon-\u03b3 production in CD4<sup>+</sup> T\u2009cells<sup>3</sup> and agonism of the pregnane\u2009X receptor<sup>4</sup>. Culture of bacteria belonging to the Bifidobacterium, Clostridium and Enterococcus genera produced these bile amidates.

This research aims to analyze the clinical symptoms and pathogenesis of a Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced canine IBD model and evaluate the restorative effect of ginsenoside from a pathogenesis perspective. We established the DSS-induced canine IBD model and studied the pathological mechanisms. Additionally, we examined the therapeutic effect of ginsenosides by assessing the Canine Inflammatory Bowel Disease Activity Index (CIBDAI), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, colonic tissue morphology, protein expression, and mucosal bacterial community analysis. Our findings revealed a total ginsenoside content of 22.7% in the ginsenoside extract. Animal experiments demonstrated that dogs with IBD exhibited decreased mental state, significantly increased CIBDAI and CRP levels, disrupted colonic epithelial tissue structure, decreased expression of mucin, tight junctions, and adherens junctions, as well as reduced diversity of the colonic mucosal bacterial community. Furthermore, correlation analysis highlighted a total of 38 bacterial strains correlated with physiological indices. Significantly, ginsenoside treatment could improve these symptoms and reverse the relative abundance of some bacterial communities. In conclusion, alterations in the properties of the colonic mucus layer or the reduction in MUC2, its core component, in dogs with IBD can lead to bacterial penetration of the mucus layer and subsequent contact with intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in inflammation. Remarkably, ginsenoside intervention showcased the capacity to positively influence the relative abundance of bacteria and impact the colonic mucus layer properties, thereby offering promising prospects for IBD management and recovery.",

        "Abstract": "Although inflammatory bowel diseases are on the rise, what factors influence IBD risk and severity, and the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully understood. Although host genetics, microbiome, and environmental factors have all been shown to correlate with the development of IBD, cause and effect are difficult to disentangle in this context. For example, AIEC is a known pathobiont found in IBD patients, but it remains unclear if gut inflammation during IBD facilitates colonization with AIEC, or if AIEC colonization makes the host more susceptible to pro-inflammatory stimuli. It is critical to understand the mechanisms that contribute to AIEC infections in a susceptible host in order to develop successful therapeutics. Here, we show that the larval zebrafish model recapitulates key features of AIEC infections in other animal models and can be utilized to address these gaps in knowledge.",

        "Abstract": "The relationship between multiple sclerosis and the gut microbiome has been supported by animal models in which commensal microbes are required for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. However, observational study findings in humans have only occasionally converged when comparing multiple sclerosis cases and controls which may in part reflect confounding by comorbidities and disease duration. The study of microbiome in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis offers unique opportunities as it is closer to biological disease onset and minimizes confounding by comorbidities and environmental exposures. A multicenter case-control study in which 35 pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis cases were 1:1 matched to healthy controls on age, sex, self-reported race, ethnicity, and recruiting site. Linear mixed effects models, weighted correlation network analyses, and PICRUSt2 were used to identify microbial co-occurrence networks and for predicting functional abundances based on marker gene sequences. Two microbial co-occurrence networks (one reaching significance after adjustment for multiple comparisons; q\u2009<\u20090.2) were identified, suggesting interdependent bacterial taxa that exhibited association with disease status. Both networks indicated a potentially protective effect of higher relative abundance of bacteria observed in these clusters. Functional predictions from the significant network suggested a contribution of short-chain fatty acid producers through anaerobic fermentation pathways in healthy controls. Consistent family-level findings from an independent Canadian-US study (19 case/control pairs) included Ruminococaccaeae and Lachnospiraceae (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Macronutrient intake was not significantly different between cases and controls, minimizing the potential for dietary confounding. Our results suggest that short-chain fatty acid producers may be important contributors to multiple sclerosis onset.",

        "Abstract": "A significant body of literature has interrogated the critical role of diet in the development and management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This review provides a summary and critical appraisal of the literature in this area, focussing on four distinct themes: nutritional epidemiology, animal and in vitro experiments, enteral nutrition, and food-based dietary therapies. Nutritional epidemiology and data from experiments in animals indicate that a western-type diet pattern is associated with increased risk of IBD onset. However, these findings have not been consistently replicated in the dietary management of IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is the only dietary therapy with reproducible evidence of efficacy in the management of active Crohn's disease (CD). Use of EEN may also be useful for improving perioperative outcomes in CD, and as an adjuvant therapy to biologic therapy. Several dietary therapies for CD and ulcerative colitis have been proposed in the literature, but replication in well-controlled studies is needed before their routine use enters the clinical setting. Precision nutritional therapy might be an attractive therapeutic paradigm in a heterogenous disease like IBD. However, no recommendations for personalised dietary therapy can currently be made, and it is imperative we unravel the complex interplay between diet and gut inflammation before we are able to do so. Undoubtedly, diet is of critical importance in the development and management of IBD. However, the exact mechanism by which diet causes gut inflammation is still elusive, and dietary guidance is difficult to formulate.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial disease, which is thought to be an interplay between genetic, environment, microbiota, and immune-mediated factors. Dysbiosis in the gut microbial composition, caused by antibiotics and diet, is closely related to the initiation and progression of IBD. Differences in gut microbiota composition between IBD patients and healthy individuals have been found, with reduced biodiversity of commensal microbes and colonization of opportunistic microbes in IBD patients. Gut microbiota can, therefore, potentially be used for diagnosing and prognosticating IBD, and predicting its treatment response. Currently, there are no curative therapies for IBD. Microbiota-based interventions, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, have been recognized as promising therapeutic strategies. Clinical studies and studies done in animal models have provided sufficient evidence that microbiota-based interventions may improve inflammation, the remission rate, and microscopic aspects of IBD. Further studies are required to better understand the mechanisms of action of such interventions. This will help in enhancing their effectiveness and developing personalized therapies. The present review summarizes the relationship between gut microbiota and IBD immunopathogenesis. It also discusses the use of gut microbiota as a noninvasive biomarker and potential therapeutic option.",

Blocking \u03b14\u03b27 from binding its cognate addressin MAdCAM-1 on intestinal blood vessel endothelial cells prevents T cells from migrating to the gut mucosa in animal models. However, data supporting this mechanism of action in humans is limited. We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study to evaluate the effect of vedolizumab on intestinal immune cell populations while avoiding the confounding effect of resolving inflammation on the cellularity of the colonic mucosa in treatment-responsive patients. Colon biopsies from 65 case subjects receiving vedolizumab were matched with biopsies from 65 control individuals, similar in disease type, medications, anatomic location, and inflammation. Biopsies were analyzed by flow cytometry and full messenger RNA transcriptome sequencing of sorted T cells. No difference was seen between vedolizumab recipients and control individuals in the quantity of any antigen-experienced T lymphocyte subset or in the quality of the transcriptome in any experienced T cell subset. Fewer na\u00efve colonic B and T cells were seen in vedolizumab recipients than control individuals, regardless of response. However, the most striking finding was a marked reduction in CD1c+ (BDCA1+) dendritic cells exclusively in vedolizumab-responsive patients. In blood, these dendritic cells ubiquitously express high levels of \u03b14\u03b27, which is rapidly downregulated upon vedolizumab exposure. The clinical effects of vedolizumab reveal integrin \u03b14\u03b27-dependent dendritic cell migration to the intestinal mucosa to be central to inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis.",

There have been growing preclinical and clinical findings that show an association between MAIT cells and the physiopathology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Of note, published reports demonstrate contradictory findings regarding the role of MAIT cells in IBD patients. A number of reports suggests a protective effect, whereas others show a pathogenic impact. The present review article aimed to explore and discuss the findings of experimental and clinical investigations evaluating the effects of MAIT cells in IBD subjects and animal models. Findings indicate that MAIT cells could exert opposite effects in the course of IBD, including an anti-inflammatory protective effect of blood circulating MAIT cells and an effector pathogenic effect of colonic MAIT cells. Another important finding is that blood levels of MAIT cells can be considered as a potential biomarker in IBD patients.",

        "Abstract": "Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of paratuberculosis, a chronic gastrointestinal disease affecting ruminants. This disease remains widespread in part due to the limitations of available diagnostics and vaccines. A representative small animal model of disease could act as a valuable tool for studying its pathogenesis and to develop new methods for paratuberculosis control, but current models are lacking. Streptomycin pre-treatment can reduce colonization resistance and has previously been shown to improve enteric infection in a Salmonella model. Here, we investigated whether streptomycin pre-treatment of mice followed by MAP gavage could act as a model of paratuberculosis which mimics the natural route of infection and disease development in ruminants. The infection outcomes of MAP were compared to M. avium subsp. hominissuis (MAH), an environmental mycobacterium, and M. bovis and M. orygis, two tuberculous mycobacteria. Streptomycin pre-treatment was shown to consistently improve bacterial infection post-oral inoculation. This model led to chronic MAP infection of the intestines and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) up to 24-weeks post-gavage, however there was no evidence of inflammation or disease. These infection outcomes were found to be specific to MAP. When the model was applied to a bacterium of lesser virulence MAH, the infection was comparatively transient. Mice infected with bacteria of greater virulence, M. bovis or M. orygis, developed chronic intestinal and MLN infection with pulmonary disease similar to zoonotic TB. Our findings suggest that a streptomycin pre-treatment mouse model could be applied to future studies to improve enteric infection with MAP and to investigate other modifications underlying MAP enteritis.",

        "Title": "Vitamin D for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.",
        "Abstract": "Vitamin D possesses immunomodulatory properties and has been implicated in the pathogenesis and severity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Animal studies and emerging epidemiological evidence have demonstrated an association between vitamin D deficiency and worse disease activity. However, the role of vitamin D for the treatment of IBD is unclear. To evaluate the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment for IBD. We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was Jun 2023. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of all ages with active or inactive IBD comparing any dose of vitamin D with another dose of vitamin D, another intervention, placebo, or no intervention. We defined doses as: vitamin D (all doses), any-treatment-dose vitamin D (greater than 400 IU/day), high-treatment-dose vitamin D (greater than 1000 IU/day), low-treatment-dose vitamin D (400 IU/day to 1000 IU/day), and supplemental-dose vitamin D (less than 400 IU/day). We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. clinical response for people with active disease, 2. clinical relapse for people in remission, 3. quality of life, and 4. withdrawals due to adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 5. disease activity at end of study, 6. normalisation of vitamin D levels at end of study, and 7. total serious adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. We included 22 RCTs with 1874 participants. Study duration ranged from four to 52 weeks. Ten studies enroled people with Crohn's disease (CD), five enroled people with ulcerative colitis (UC), and seven enroled people with CD and people with UC. Seventeen studies included adults, three included children, and two included both. Four studies enroled people with active disease, six enroled people in remission, and 12 enroled both. We assessed each study for risk of bias across seven individual domains. Five studies were at low risk of bias across all seven domains. Ten studies were at unclear risk of bias in at least one domain but with no areas of high risk of bias. Seven studies were at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and assessors. Vitamin D (all doses) versus placebo or no treatment Thirteen studies compared vitamin D against placebo or no treatment. We could not draw any conclusions on clinical response for UC as the certainty of the evidence was very low (risk ratio (RR) 4.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51 to 10.57; 1 study, 60 participants). There were no data on CD. There may be fewer clinical relapses for IBD when using vitamin D compared to placebo or no treatment (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.96; 3 studies, 310 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low. We could not draw any conclusions on quality of life for IBD (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.13, 95% CI -3.10 to 2.83 (the SMD value indicates a negligent decrease in quality of life, and the corresponding CIs indicate that the effect can range from a large decrease to a large increase in quality of life); 2 studies, 243 participants) or withdrawals due to adverse events for IBD (RR 1.97, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.27; 12 studies, 1251 participants; note 11 studies reported withdrawals but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 1 study rather than 12). The certainty of the evidence was very low. High-treatment-dose vitamin D versus low-treatment-dose vitamin D Five studies compared high treatment vitamin D doses against low treatment vitamin D doses. There were no data on clinical response. There may be no difference in clinical relapse for CD (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.01; 1 study, 34 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low. We could not draw any conclusions on withdrawals due to adverse events for IBD as the certainty of the evidence was very low (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.08; 3 studies, 104 participants; note 2 studies reported withdrawals but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 1 study rather than 3). The data on quality of life and disease activity could not be meta-analysed, were of very low certainty, and no conclusions could be drawn. Any-treatment-dose vitamin D versus supplemental-dose vitamin D Four studies compared treatment doses of vitamin D against supplemental doses. There were no data on clinical response and relapse. There were no data on quality of life that could be meta-analysed. We could not draw any conclusions on withdrawals due to adverse events for IBD as the certainty of the evidence was very low (RR 3.09, 95% CI 0.13 to 73.17; 4 studies, 233 participants; note 3 studies reported withdrawals but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 1 study rather than 4). There may be fewer clinical relapses when comparing vitamin D with placebo, but we cannot draw any conclusions on differences in clinical response, quality of life, or withdrawals, due to very low-certainty evidence. When comparing high and low doses of vitamin D, there were no data for clinical response, but there may be no difference in relapse for CD. We cannot draw conclusions on the other outcomes due to very low certainty evidence. Finally, comparing vitamin D (all doses) to supplemental-dose vitamin D, there were no data on clinical relapse or response, and we could not draw conclusions on other outcomes due to very low certainty evidence or missing data. It is difficult to make any clear recommendations for future research on the basis of the findings of this review. Future studies must be clear on the baseline populations, the purpose of vitamin D treatment, and, therefore, study an appropriate dosing strategy. Stakeholders in the field may wish to reach consensus on such issues prior to new studies.",

In this review, we present a literature overview of the interactions between diet and E. coli and other Proteobacteria in the aetiology, outcomes and management of IBD and suggest future research directions. An extensive literature search was performed to identify in vitro studies and research in animal models that explored mechanisms by which dietary components can interact with E. coli or Proteobacteria to initiate or propagate gut inflammation. We also explored the effect diet and dietary therapies have on the levels of E. coli or Proteobacteria in patients with IBD. Preclinical data suggest that the Western diet and its components influence the abundance, colonisation and phenotypic behaviour of E. coli in the gut, which may in turn initiate or contribute to gut inflammation. In contrast, the Mediterranean diet and specific dietary fibres may abrogate these effects and protect from inflammation. There are limited data from clinical trials, mostly from patients with Crohn's disease during treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition, with findings often challenging observations from preclinical research. Data from patients with ulcerative colitis are sparse. Preclinical and some clinical trial data suggest that E. coli and other Proteobacteria interact with certain dietary components to promote gut inflammation. Well-designed clinical trials are required before dietary recommendations for disease management can be made.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a public health issue with a growing prevalence, which can be divided into two phenotypes, namely Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Currently, used therapy is based only on symptomatic and/or palliative pharmacological approaches. These treatments seek to induce and maintain remission of the disease and ameliorate its secondary effects; however, they do not modify or reverse the underlying pathogenic mechanism. Therefore, it is essential to investigate new potential treatments. Carbamylated erythropoietin (cEPO) results from the modification of the Erythropoietin (EPO) molecule, reducing cardiovascular-related side effects from the natural erythropoiesis stimulation. cEPO has been studied throughout several animal models, which demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect by decreasing the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cEPO in a chronic TNBS-induced colitis model in rodents. Experimental colitis was induced by weekly intrarectal (IR) administrations of 1% TNBS for 5 weeks in female <i>CD-1 mice</i>. Then, the <i>mice</i> were treated with 500 IU/kg/day or 1000 IU/kg/day of cEPO through intraperitoneal injections for 14 days. cEPO significantly reduced the concentration of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), fecal hemoglobin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and interleukin (IL)-10. Also, it demonstrated a beneficial influence on the extra-intestinal manifestations, with the absence of significant side effects of its use. Considering the positive results from cEPO in this experiment, it may arise as a new possible pharmacological approach for the future management of IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is one of the 2 main phenotypes of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs); CD ischaracterized by a discontinuous, spontaneously recurring, transmural immunopathology that largely affects the terminal ileum. Crohn's disease exhibits both a relapsing and progressive course, and its prevalence is on the rise globally, mirroring the trends of industrialization. While the precise pathogenesis of CD remains unknown, various factors including immune cell dysregulation, microbial dysbiosis, genetic susceptibility, and environmental factors have been implicated in disease etiology. Animal models, particularly ileitis mouse models, have provided valuable tools for studying the specific mechanisms underlying CD, allowing longitudinal assessment and sampling in interventional preclinical studies. Furthermore, animal models assess to evaluate the distinct role that bacterial and dietary antigens play in causing inflammation, using germ-free animals, involving the introduction of individual bacteria (monoassociation studies), and experimenting with well-defined dietary components. An ideal animal model for studying IBD, specifically CD, should exhibit an inherent intestinal condition that arises spontaneously and closely mimics the distinct transmural inflammation observed in the human disease, particularly in the terminal ileum. We have recently characterized the impact of disease-relevant, noninfectious microbiota and specific bacteria in a mouse model that replicates CD-like ileitis, capturing the intricate nature of human CD, namely the TNF\u2206ARE mouse model. Using germ-free mice, we studied the impact of different diets on the expansion of disease-relevant pathobionts and on the severity of inflammation. In this review article, we review some of the currently available ileitis mouse models and discuss in detail the TNF\u2206ARE model of CD-like Ileitis.",

        "Abstract": "The management of inflammatory bowel disease requires continuous medical therapy to achieve and maintain disease control. Thus, women can be exposed to different drugs during conception, pregnancy, and lactation with potentially harmful effects on the mother, foetus, or nursing infant. Conventional drugs and anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 are considered safe and can be maintained throughout all these phases. Emergent, although limited, data support safety of vedolizumab and ustekinumab, with pregnancy, as well as maternal and neonatal outcomes comparable to women unexposed or treated with anti TNF-\u03b1 drugs. Placental pharmacokinetics differ between these two biologics, with an inverse infant-to-maternal ratio for vedolizumab, whereas ustekinumab shows a similar profile to anti TNF-\u03b1 drugs. The clearance of vedolizumab in exposed offspring seems to be faster than anti TNF-\u03b1, estimated around 15 and 19 weeks of age, respectively. Currently, the decision to interrupt or maintain these treatments is up to physicians' judgement on a case-by-case basis. In animal studies, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and ozanimod have shown embryotoxicity and teratogenicity. Moreover, tofacitinib and filgotinib seemingly affect female fertility.

Twelve of the 14 animals examined showed evidence for the presence of MSIs and microevolution, while the genotypes of MAP isolates from the remaining two animals could be attributed solely to microevolution. All MAP isolates that were otherwise isogenic had differences in short sequence repeats (SSRs), of which SSR1 and SSR2 were the most diverse and homoplastic. Variations in SSR1 and SSR2, which are located in <i>ORF1</i> and <i>ORF2</i>, respectively, affect the genetic reading frame, leading to protein products with altered sequences and computed structures. The ORF1 gene product is predicted to be a MAP surface protein with possible roles in host immune modulation, but nothing could be inferred regarding the function of ORF2. Both genes are conserved in <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> complex members, but SSR1-based modulation of <i>ORF1</i> reading frames seems to only occur in MAP, which could have potential implications on the infectivity of this pathogen. IMPORTANCE Johne's disease (JD) is a major problem in dairy animals, and concerns have been raised regarding the association of <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> subsp. <i>paratuberculosis</i> (MAP) with Crohn's disease in humans. MAP is an extremely slow-growing bacterium with low genome evolutionary rates. Certain short sequence repeats (SSR1 and SSR2) in the MAP chromosome are highly variable and evolve at a faster rate than the rest of the chromosome. In the current study, multiple MAP isolates with genetic variations such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and more noticeably, diverse SSRs, could simultaneously infect animals. Variations in SSR1 and SSR2 affect the products of the respective genes containing them. Since multiple MAP isolates can infect the same animal and the possibility that the pathogen undergoes further changes within the host due to unstable SSRs, this could provide a compensative mechanism for an otherwise slow-evolving pathogen to increase phenotypic diversity for overcoming host responses.",

        "Abstract": "The development of animal models reflecting the pathologies of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) remains a major challenge. The NOD/SCID/IL2r\u03b3<sup>null</sup> (NSG) mouse strain, which is immune-compromised, tolerates the engraftment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from patients with UC (NSG-UC) or CD (NSG-CD). This offers the opportunity to examine the impact of individual immunological background on the development of pathophysiological manifestations. When challenged with ethanol, NSG-UC mice exhibited a strong pro-inflammatory response, including the development of edemas, influx of human T cells, B cells and monocytes into the mucosa and submucosa, and elevated expression of the inflammatory markers CRP and CCL-7. Fibrotic alterations were characterized by an influx of fibroblasts and a thickening of the muscularis mucosae. In contrast, the development of pathological manifestations in NSG-CD mice developed without challenge and was signified by extensive collagen deposition between the muscularis propria and muscularis mucosae, as observed in the areas of strictures in CD patients. Vimentin-expressing fibroblasts supplanting colonic crypts and elevated expression of HGF and TGF\u00df corroborated the remodeling phenotype. In summary, the NSG-UC and NSG-CD models partially reflect these human diseases and are powerful tools to examine the mechanism underlying the inflammatory processes in UC and CD.",

        "Abstract": "Fibroblasts play a key role in stricture formation in Crohn's disease (CD) but understanding its pathogenesis requires a systems-level investigation to uncover new treatment targets. We studied full-thickness CD tissues to characterize fibroblast heterogeneity and function by generating the first single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) atlas of strictured bowel and providing proof of principle for therapeutic target validation. We performed scRNAseq of 13 fresh full-thickness CD resections containing noninvolved, inflamed nonstrictured, and strictured segments as well as 7 normal non-CD bowel segments. Each segment was separated into mucosa/submucosa or muscularis propria and analyzed separately for a total of 99 tissue samples and 409,001 cells. We validated cadherin-11 (CDH11) as a potential therapeutic target by using whole tissues, isolated intestinal cells, NanoString nCounter, next-generation sequencing, proteomics, and animal models. Our integrated dataset revealed fibroblast heterogeneity in strictured CD with the majority of stricture-selective changes detected in the mucosa/submucosa, but not the muscle layer. Cell-cell interaction modeling revealed CXCL14+ as well as MMP/WNT5A+ fibroblasts displaying a central signaling role in CD strictures. CDH11, a fibroblast cell-cell adhesion molecule, was broadly expressed and up-regulated, and its profibrotic function was validated using NanoString nCounter, RNA sequencing, tissue target expression, in\u00a0vitro gain- and loss-of-function experiments, proteomics, and knock-out and antibody-mediated CDH11 blockade in experimental colitis. A full-thickness bowel scRNAseq atlas revealed previously unrecognized fibroblast heterogeneity and interactions in CD strictures and CDH11 was validated as a potential therapeutic target. These results provide a new resource for a better understanding of CD stricture formation and open potential therapeutic developments.

        "Abstract": "Interleukins are considered to be potential therapeutic targets that can alter the prognosis and disease progression of IBD. IL-21 has proven to be involved in effector Th1, Th2 and Th17 responses. Similarly, IL-33, a newly identified cytokine, has been shown to control the Th1 effector response and the action of the colonic Tregs in animal models of colitis and patients with IBD. In this retrospective study, we have studied the expression of these interleukins, using immunohistochemistry, in 121 patients with moderate to severe IBD before and after treatment with biologics. The results were statistically processed using SPSS<sup>TM</sup>. Increased IL-21 expression was found in the UC and CD groups versus the controls. The IL-33 expression was found to be increased in the post-treatment UC and CD groups, suggesting a protective role of this interleukin against bowel inflammation. The IL-33 expression post-treatment was reversely correlated with the activity index score in CD patients, suggesting a better response to treatment in patients with higher IL-33 mucosa levels. This is the first immunohistochemical study of the expression of those interleukins in bowel mucosa before and after treatment with biologics. These data support a possibly promising future use of these interleukins as biomarkers of severe disease and response to treatment and as potential therapeutic targets for novel monoclonal antibodies.",

        "Abstract": "Although ileal faecal diversion is commonly used in clinical settings, complications accompany it. Elucidating the intestinal changes caused by ileal faecal diversion will help resolve postoperative complications and elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of associated intestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease (CD). Therefore, our study aimed to provide new insights into the effects of ileal faecal diversion on the intestine and the potential mechanisms. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on proximal functional and paired distal defunctioned intestinal mucosae from three patients with ileal faecal diversion. We also performed in vitro cellular and animal experiments, tissue staining and analysed public datasets to validate our findings. We found that the epithelium in the defunctioned intestine tended to be immature, with defective mechanical and mucous barriers. However, the innate immune barrier in the defunctioned intestine was enhanced. Focusing on the changes in goblet cells, we demonstrated that mechanical stimulation promotes the differentiation and maturation of goblet cells through the TRPA1-ERK pathway, indicating that the absence of mechanical stimulation may be the main cause of defects in the goblet cells of the defunctioned intestine. Furthermore, we found obvious fibrosis with a pro-fibrotic microenvironment in the defunctioned intestine and identified that monocytes may be important targets for faecal diversion to alleviate CD. This study revealed the different transcription landscapes of various cell subsets and the potential underlying mechanisms within the defunctioned intestine, when compared to the functional intestine, based on the background of ileal faecal diversion. These findings provide novel insights for understanding the physiological and pathological roles of the faecal stream in the intestine.",

        "Abstract": "M1 polarization of macrophages in the intestine is an important maintenance factor of the inflammatory response in Crohn's disease (CD). Eriocalyxin B (EriB) is a natural medicine that antagonizes inflammation. Our study aimed to determine the effects of EriB on CD-like colitis in mice, as well as the possible mechanism. 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) mice and Il-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice were used as CD animal models, and the therapeutic effect of EriB on CD-like colitis in mice was addressed by the disease activity index (DAI) score, weight change, histological analysis and flow cytometry assay. To assess the direct role of EriB in regulating macrophage polarization, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were induced to M1 or M2 polarization separately. Molecular docking simulations and blocking experiments were performed to explore the potential mechanisms by which EriB regulates the macrophage polarization. EriB treatment reduced body weight loss, DAI score and histological score, demonstrating the improvement of colitis symptoms in mice. In vivo and in vitro experiments both showed that EriB decreased the M1 polarization of macrophages, and suppressed the release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) in mouse colons and BMDMs. The activation of Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (JAK2/STAT1) signals could be inhibited by EriB, which may be related to the regulation of EriB on M1 polarization. EriB inhibits the M1 polarization of macrophages by attenuating the JAK2/STAT1 pathway, which partially explains the potential mechanism by which EriB ameliorates colitis in mice, and provides a new regimen for the clinical treatment of CD.",

However, there are currently no effective treatments or medications available for individuals with CD. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. The bioactive compounds and targets associated with compounds of Qinghua Xiaoyong Formula (QHXYF) were examined using The Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database, and 5 disease target databases were also used to identify CD-related disease targets. A total of 166 overlapping targets were identified from QHXYF-related and CD-related disease targets and they were found to be enriched in oxidative stress-related pathways and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Molecular docking was then used to predict how the bioactive compounds would bind to the hub targets. It was found that quercetin could be the core bioactive compound and had good binding affinity to the top 5 hub targets. Finally, animal experiments were performed to further validate the findings, and the results revealed that QHXYF or quercetin inhibited 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced inflammation and oxidative stress processes by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby improving CD symptoms. These findings suggest that QHXYF and quercetin may be potential novel treatments for CD.",

Although the exact etiology of this chronic intestinal disease is not fully understood, nutritional factors appear to play key roles. Furthermore, individuals with IBD are at increased risk of adverse nutritional impacts, including micronutrient deficiencies. This review aims to summarize recent reports focusing on nutritional factors relevant to the development of IBD and to also review data on nutritional deficiencies seen in individuals with IBD. The typical western diet, characterized by high-fat/high-sugar foods, along with food additives, appears to contribute to the etiopathogenesis of IBD. In contrast, some reports indicate that some foods are likely protective. However, there are inconsistencies in the currently available data, reflecting study design and other confounding factors. Furthermore, some of the conclusions are inferred from animal or in vitro studies. The presence of IBD can compromise the nutrition of individuals with one of these disorders: ongoing monitoring is critical.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for sensitive, specific, fast and non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis of IBD in medical research. Urine is an excellent biofluid for discovering biomarkers because it is non-invasive to sample. In this review, we aimed to summarize proteomics and metabolomics studies performed in both animal models of IBD and humans that identify urinary biomarkers for IBD diagnosis.

Results of studies using available small and large animal models are often poorly translatable to patients, and few CD models show small intestinal pathology. Due to its similarities to humans, the pig has emerged as a highly suitable translational disease model, particularly for testing novel nutritional and technological interventions. Our goal was to develop a physiologically relevant porcine CD model to facilitate translation of findings and interventions towards the clinic. We generated pigs bearing a 93-bp deletion of the adenosine-uracil-rich element [ARE] and a constitutive-decay element within the 3' untranslated region of the TNF gene. Comparative analysis of physiological, molecular, histological and microbial characteristics was performed between wild-type, TNF\u0394ARE/+ and TNF\u0394ARE/\u0394ARE animals. Alterations in the microbiome were compared to the TNF\u0394ARE mouse model and IBD patients. TNF \u0394ARE pigs recapitulate major characteristics of human CD, including ulcerative transmural ileocolitis, increased abundance of proinflammatory cytokines, immune cell infiltration and dysbiotic microbial communities. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed enrichment in members belonging to Megasphaera, Campylobacter, Desulfovibrio, Alistipes and Lachnoclostridum in faecal or mucosa-associated bacteria compared to wild-type littermates. Principal components analysis clustering with a subset of TNF\u0394ARE/+ mice and human IBD patients suggests microbial similarity based on disease severity. We demonstrate that the TNF\u0394ARE pig resembles a CD-like ileocolitis pathophenotype recapitulating human disease. The ability to conduct long-term studies and test novel surgical procedures and dietary interventions in a physiologically relevant model will benefit future translational IBD research studies.",

        "Abstract": "Perianal Crohn's disease is associated with poor outcomes and high medical costs. It is notoriously difficult to treat despite therapeutic advancements for luminal disease. A large animal model that mimics human perianal disease is needed to test innovative therapies. This study aimed to create a swine model that replicates the inflammatory component and therapeutic challenges found in patients with perianal Crohn's disease. This was an animal preclinical study. The experiments were performed at the animal laboratory at the Johns Hopkins University. Four sus scrufus female pigs were included in the study. Four female pigs underwent creation of 3 surgical perianal fistulas each, 1 rectovaginal and 2 perianal. Size 24 French setons were placed to maintain patency of the fistula tracts for 4 weeks. After removal of the setons, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid was administered into the fistula tract to create and maintain local inflammation mimicking perianal Crohn's disease. An MRI was obtained to assess the fistulas and the pigs were euthanized to review histopathology. Three inflammatory chronic fistula tracts were successfully created in each pig as confirmed by MRI and examination under anesthesia. This is the first report of maintaining patent fistulas in swine 2 weeks after removal of setons. For the first time, we reported that 2 pigs developed branching fistulas and small abscesses reminiscent of human perianal Crohn's disease. The corresponding histopathologic examination found significant chronic active inflammation on standard hematoxylin and eosin staining. The fistulas were surgically induced and did not occur naturally. A chronic perianal fistula model in pigs that strongly resembles human perianal Crohn's disease was successfully created. This model can be used to test novel therapeutics and techniques to pave the path for human trials. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B969 .

        "Abstract": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and are abundant in fish oil. These n-3 PUFAs have been reported to improve the lower gastrointestinal (LGI) disorders such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease through their anti-inflammatory effects. However, there are few studies on the effect of n-3 PUFAs on motility of the LGI tract, such as the ileum and colon, the parts frequently affected by these inflammatory disorders. To elucidate the effects of DHA and EPA on the LGI tract motility, we performed comparative evaluation of their effects and linoleic acid (LA), an n-6 PUFA, on contractions in the ileal and colonic longitudinal smooth muscles (LSMs) isolated from guinea pigs. In the ileal and colonic LSMs, DHA and EPA (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup>\u2009M each) significantly inhibited contractions induced by acetylcholine (ACh), histamine, and prostaglandin (PG) F<sub>2\u03b1</sub> (vs. control), and these effects are stronger than that of LA (3\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup>\u2009M). In the colonic LSMs, DHA and EPA also significantly inhibited contractions induced by PGD<sub>2</sub> (vs. control). In addition, DHA and EPA significantly inhibited CaCl<sub>2</sub>-induced ileal and colonic LSM contractions in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free 80\u2009mM-KCl solution (vs. control). Any ileal and colonic LSM contractions induced by ACh, histamine, PGF<sub>2\u03b1</sub>, and CaCl<sub>2</sub> were completely suppressed by verapamil (10<sup>-5</sup>\u2009M), a voltage-gated/dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (VGCC/VDCC) inhibitor. These findings suggest that DHA and EPA could improve the abnormal contractile functions of the LGI tract associated with inflammatory diseases, partly through inhibition of VGCC/VDCC-dependent ileal and colonic LSM contractions.",

In the majority of hosts, these symbionts contribute largely to beneficial functions promoting microbe-host homeostasis. However, an increasing number of human diseases is associated with altered microbiota composition and enrichment of certain bacterial species. A well-known example of this is Mucispirillum schaedleri, which has been associated with inflammatory conditions in the intestine. Mucispirillum spp. belong to the phylum Deferribacteres and are prevalent but low abundant members of the rodent, pig and human microbiota. Recently, M. schaedleri was causally linked to the development of Crohn's disease-like colitis in immunodeficient mice. While this study certifies a considerable pathogenic potential, the same organism can also promote health in the immunocompetent host: M. schaedleri protects from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm)-induced colitis by interfering with the expression of the pathogen\u00b4s invasion machinery. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the mammalian gut symbiont M. schaedleri and its role in intestinal homeostasis and discuss open questions and perspectives for future research.",

Here, we report for the first time its identification in human intestinal (colon) tissue, along with a series of related N-acyl serotonins. Furthermore, we tested these fatty acid conjugates for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-17 and CCL-20 by stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serotonin conjugates with palmitic acid (PA-5-HT), stearic acid (SA-5-HT) and oleic acid (OA-5-HT) were detected in higher levels than arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and DHA-5-HT, while eicosapentaenoyl serotonin (EPA-5-HT) could not be quantified. Among these, DHA-5-HT was the most potent in inhibiting IL-17 and CCL-20, typical Th17 pro-inflammatory mediators, by Concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated human PBMCs. These results underline the idea that DHA-5-HT is a gut-specific endogenously produced mediator with the capacity to modulate the IL-17/Th17 signaling response. Our findings may be of relevance in relation to intestinal inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis.",

        "Title": "An Infectious Pig Model of Crohn's Disease.",
        "Abstract": "Over the last several years, we have demonstrated that intestinal lymphangitis and lymphatic obstruction are fundamental lesions in Crohn's disease, for which no therapy is currently available. There is an infectious enteritis of young pigs that offers an opportunity to understand how the lymphangitis of CD may have been initiated. The pathology of chlamydial enteritis was described earlier, from 1987 to 2009. Tissue blocks and hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from Chlamydia suis-inoculated young pigs were provided by D. Rogers and F. Guscetti. Experimental animals, gnotobiotic and conventional, had been autopsied 4, 7, and 10 days postinoculation. Serial sections of intestine were immunostained with a Chlamydia trachomatis antibody, which cross-reacted with C. suis antigen, and compared with hematoxylin and eosin preparations. Immunohistochemistry revealed antigen in villous epithelial cells of jejunum and ileum and in the endothelium of lacteals and lymphatics by day 4. This was accompanied by lymphatic endothelial necrosis, lymphangitis, and inflammatory lymphatic obstruction, through several layers of the affected intestinal segments, days 4 through 10. Although the original authors documented lesions to define the porcine disease, here the author characterizes the lymphangitis as a model for understanding Crohn's disease and suggests a chlamydial origin for the latter.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic conditions characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation. Adherent invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) pathotype has been increasingly implicated in the etiopathogenesis of IBD. In a 21-day study, we investigated the effects of AIEC strain UM146 inoculation on microbiota profile of the ileal, cecal, ascending and descending colon in a pig model of experimental colitis. Carrageenan gum (CG) was used to induce colitis in weaner piglets whereas AIEC strain UM146 previously isolated from a CD patient was included to investigate a cause or consequence effect in IBD. Treatments were: (1) control; (2) CG; (3) AIEC strain UM146; and (4) CG+UM146. Pigs in groups 2 and 4 received 1% CG in drinking water from day 1 of the study while pigs in groups 3 and 4 were inoculated with UM146 on day 8. Following euthanization on day 21, tissue mucosal scrapings were collected and used for DNA extraction. The V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA gene was then subjected to Illumina sequencing. Microbial diversity, composition, and the predicted functional metagenome were determined in addition to short chain fatty acids profiles in the digesta and inflammatory cytokines in the intestinal tissue. CG-induced colitis decreased bacterial species richness and shifted community composition. At the phylum level, an increase in Proteobacteria and Deferribacteres and a decrease in Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were observed in CG and CGUM146 compared to control and UM146. The metabolic capacity of the microbiome was also altered in CG and CGUM146 compared to UM146 and control in the colon. We demonstrated that CG resulted in bacterial dysbiosis and shifted community composition similar to what has been previously observed in IBD patients. However, AIEC strain UM146 alone did not cause any clear changes compared to CG or control in our experimental IBD pig model.",

        "Title": "Trichuris suis-induced modulation of human dendritic cell function is glycan-mediated.",
        "Abstract": "Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) show remarkable phenotypic changes upon direct contact with soluble products (SPs) of Trichuris suis, a pig whipworm that is experimentally used in therapies to ameliorate inflammation in patients with Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis. These changes may contribute to the observed induction of a T helper 2 (Th2) response and the suppression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced Th1 and Th17 responses by human DCs primed with T. suis SPs. Here it is demonstrated that glycans of T. suis SPs contribute significantly to the suppression of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression in DCs of a broad variety of cytokines and chemokines, including important pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12, lymphotoxin \u03b1 (LTA), C-C Motif Ligand (CCL)2, C-X-C Motif Ligands (CXCL)9 and CXCL10. In addition, the data show that human DCs strongly bind T. suis SP-glycans via the C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) mannose receptor (MR) and DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN). The interaction of DCs with T. suis glycans likely involves mannose-type glycans, rather than fucosylated glycans, which differs from DC binding to soluble egg antigens of the human worm parasite, Schistosoma mansoni. In addition, macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL) recognises T. suis SPs, which may contribute to the interaction with immature DCs or other MGL-expressing immune cells such as macrophages. The interaction of T. suis glycans with CLRs of human DCs may be essential for the ability of T. suis to suppress a pro-inflammatory phenotype of human DCs. The finding that the T. suis-induced modulation of human DC function is glycan-mediated is novel and indicates that helminth glycans contribute to the dampening of inflammation in a wide range of human inflammatory diseases.",

We investigated the immunoregulatory efficacy of CLA in patients with mild to moderate Crohn's disease (CD). Thirteen patients with mild to moderately active CD were enrolled in an open-label study of CLA (6 g/d orally) for 12 weeks. Peripheral blood was collected at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks after treatment initiation for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells for functional analyses of lymphoproliferation and cytokine production. Disease activity was calculated using the CD activity index (CDAI) and quality of life was assessed using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). CLA significantly suppressed the ability of peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets to produce IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-17 and lymphoproliferation at week 12. There was a statistically significant drop in CDAI from 245 to 187 (P = 0.013) and increase in IBDQ from 141 to 165 (P = 0.017) on week 12. Oral CLA administration was well tolerated and suppressed the ability of peripheral blood T cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, decreased disease activity and increased the quality of life of patients with CD.",

        "Title": "Axotomy induced changes in neuronal plasticity of sympathetic chain ganglia (SChG) neurons supplying descending colon in the pig.",
        "Abstract": "Sympathetic neurons are capable of extensive regeneration following axonal injury. To investigate the response to axotomy of colon-projecting neurons (CPN) localized in the porcine sympathetic chain ganglia (SChG), the retrograde Fast Blue (FB) tracer, axonal transection and double immunohistochemistry methods were applied. The CPN were localized exclusively in the lumbar SChG and displayed a predominantly catecholaminergic [i.e. Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH)/Dopamine \u03b2 Hydroxylase (D\u03b2H)] and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) positive phenotype under physiological conditions. Axotomy led to a significant decrease in TH/D\u03b2H production and a simultaneous increase in the neuropeptides Galanin (GAL) and Somatostatin (SOM), but not NPY or Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) expression in retrogradely traced perikarya. Furthermore, the decrease in density of TH-/D\u03b2H-, VIP-, Leu(5)-Enkephalin (LENK)-, Choline Acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunoreactive (-IR) nerve fibers occurred after axotomy. These data suggest a species-specific response to axonal damage of the CPN localized in porcine SChG. Since the SChG neurons supervise the vasculature of gut both in physiological and pathological conditions, and since pig is a more accurate animal model of human gut than a rodent (Swindle et al., 1992), these data may contribute to the understanding of the pathology of several gut illnesses, like Crohn Disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome which commonly affect western populations.",

        "Abstract": "Nucleotide oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) is a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that responds to muramyldipeptide (MDP), a component of peptidoglycans of gram positive and negative bacteria. NOD2 is involved in the modulation of signaling pathways for other PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors. Polymorphisms in NOD2 may evoke bowel disorders, and human Crohn's disease is significantly correlated with mis-sense insertion of the NOD2 gene. Such polymorphisms affecting ligand recognition in the NOD2 gene may also influence bowel flora in livestock, which is compromised by bowel diseases such as diarrhea. We investigated the functional variance of mis-sense polymorphisms in ligand recognition by porcine NOD2. The 1949T>C polymorphism, located in the region encoding the hinge domain of the molecule, notably diminished the functional response of porcine NOD2 to MDP. By comparison, the 2197A>C polymorphism, localized in the region corresponding to leucine-rich repeats, significantly augmented the response of porcine NOD2 to the ligand. The 1949C allele was rare among pig breeds, suggesting that this mutation is a disadvantage to pigs in their immune response to microbes. The 2197C allele, in contrast, was widely distributed among Western breeds and is most likely to be derived from wild boars in Asia. This is the first report of a causal relationship between molecular function and polymorphisms in PRRs in non-primate, non-rodent mammals. These findings suggest that the 2197C allele might confer an immune response advantage in modern pig breeds and may be a useful marker for breeding aimed at disease resistance in pigs.",

        "Abstract": "Research into Crohn's disease has recently been focused on the genetics of the patient, the gastrointestinal flora, the gut epithelium and mucosal immune responses. For over 60 years pathologists have reported that the fundamental alteration in Crohn's disease occurs in regional lymphatics of the intestine--the disease is a lymphocytic and granulomatous lymphangitis. At an earlier time, experimental sclerosis of regional intestinal lymphatics of the pig produced a chronic segmental enteritis with many features of Crohn's disease, including lymphocytic and granulomatous lymphangitis of the bowel wall and enteroenteric and enterocutaneous fistulas. In Crohn's disease, differences in the anatomic distribution of vasa recta appear to explain long-segment disease of the ileum and short-segment disease of the more proximal intestine. A variety of bacteria and viruses cause lymphangitis, suggesting that microorganisms may be at the centre of the basic changes in Crohn's disease. Dietary antigens and lipids are worthy of consideration as well. Now that antibodies to label lymphatics are available, attention should be directed at defining the initial damage to lymphatic endothelium and agents that might be responsible.",

We studied 207 consecutive patients (99 men, 108 women; age range, 17-84 years) who underwent intestinal biopsy for suspected CD. Patients presented with one or more of the following: weight loss, anemia, chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, alternating bowel habits, constipation, pain in the joints, and dermatitis. At entry to the study, an intestinal biopsy was performed and a serum sample was taken for IgA EmAs, anti-gp-tTG, and anti-h-tTG. Intestinal histology showed that 24 patients had partial or total villous atrophy; in these patients the diagnosis of CD was confirmed by follow-up. The remaining 183 patients had villous/crypt ratios that were within our laboratory's reference values and were considered controls. Serum EmAs, anti-gp-tTG, and anti-h-tTG were positive in all 24 CD patients; in the control group, none were positive for serum EmAs, but 15 of 183 (8.2%) were positive for anti-gp-tTG, and 6 of 183 (3.3%) were positive for anti-h-tTG.

Areas (95% CIs) under the ROC curves were 0.987 (0.97-1.0) for anti-h-tTG and 0.965 (0.94-0.99) for anti-gp-tTG.

However, most of the studies on anti-tTG assay have considered pre-selected groups of patients and not consecutive subjects with suspected CD. The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA), EmA and two anti-tTG ELISAs, one based on guinea pig (gp)-tTG and the other on human (h)-tTG as antigens, in consecutive patients investigated for suspected CD. The study included 130 consecutive patients (age range 16-84 years), who underwent intestinal biopsy for suspected CD. They presented with one or more of the following symptoms: weight loss, anemia, chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, alternating bowel habits and constipation. At the time of admission in the study, an intestinal biopsy was performed and a serum sample was taken for immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA AGA, IgA EmA, anti-gp-tTG and anti-h-TG determination. Intestinal histology revealed that 15 patients had partial or total villous atrophy. In these patients the diagnosis of CD was confirmed at subsequent follow-up. The remaining 115 patients included in the study had an intestinal histology characterized by a normal villi/crypts ratio and were considered as controls. Serum EmA, anti-gp-tTG, and anti-h-tTG were positive in all the 15 CD subjects, whereas IgG and IgA AGA were positive in 10/15; in the control group, none were positive for serum EmA, but 11/115 (10%) were positive for anti-gp-tTG and 6/115 (5%) were positive for anti-h-tTG. The sensitivity was 100% for EmA, gp-tTG and h-tTG and 66% for IgA and IgG AGA. The specificity was 100% for EmA, 90% for anti-gp-tTG, 95% for anti-h-tTG, 74% for IgG AGA and 87% for IgA AGA. The negative predictive value was 100% for EmA, anti-h-tTG and anti-gp-tTG, 94% for IgG AGA and 95% for IgA AGA. The positive predictive value was 100% for EmA, 71% for anti-h-tTG (p = 0.03 vs EmA) and 58% for anti-gp-tTG (p = 0.003 vs EmA). Most of the patients who were false positive for anti-tTG had Crohn's disease or chronic liver disease. In conclusion, although both the anti-tTG ELISAs evaluated in the present study showed an optimum sensitivity, their low specificity determined positive predictive values which were significantly lower than those of EmA assay. Besides, the positive predictive value of gp-tTG was too low to warrant submitting a patient to intestinal biopsy for suspected CD.",

        "Abstract": "Growth hormone (GH) is used or is being evaluated for efficacy in treatment of short stature, aspects of aging, cardiac disorders, Crohn's disease, and short bowel syndrome. Therefore, we synthesized several stable growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) analogues that could be therapeutically useful. One potent analog, [D-Ala(2),Aib(8, 18,)Ala(9, 15, 16, 22, 24-26,)Gab(27)]hGRF(1-27)NH(2) (GRF-6), with prolonged infusion caused severe diarrhea in monkeys; however, it had no side-effects in rats. Because GRF has similarity to VIP/PACAP and VIPomas cause diarrhea, this study investigated the ability of this and other GRF analogues to interact with the VIP/PACAP receptors. Rat VPAC(1)-R (rVPAC(1)-R), human VPAC(1)-R (hVPAC(1)-R), rVPAC(2)-R and hVPAC(2)-R stably transfected CHO and PANC 1 cells were made and T47D breast cancer cells containing native human VPAC(1)-R and AR4-2J cells containing PAC(1)-R were used. hGRF(1-29)NH(2) had low affinity for both rVPAC(1)-R and rVPAC(2)-R while VIP had a high affinity for both receptors. GRF-6 had a low affinity for both rVPAC(1)-R and rVPAC(2)-R and very low affinity for the rPAC(1)-R. VIP had a high affinity, whereas hGRF(1-29)NH(2) had a low affinity for both hVPAC(1)-R and hVPAC(2)-R. In contrast GRF-6, while having a low affinity for hVPAC(2)-R, had relatively higher affinity for the hVPAC(1)-R. In guinea pig pancreatic acini, all GRF analogues were full agonists at the VPAC(1)-R causing enzyme secretion. These results demonstrate that in contrast to native hGRF(1-29)NH(2,) GRF-6 has a relatively high affinity for the human VPAC(1)-R but not for the human VPAC(2)-R, rat VPAC(1)-R, rat VPAC(2)-R or rat PAC(1)-R. These results suggest that the substituted GRF analog, GRF-6, likely causes the diarrheal side-effects in monkeys by interacting with the VPAC(1)-R. Furthermore, they demonstrate significant species differences can exist for possible therapeutic peptide agonists of the VIP/PACAP/GRF receptor family and that it is essential that receptor affinity assessments be performed in human cells or from a closely related species.",

        "Title": "Human recombinant tissue transglutaminase ELISA: an innovative diagnostic assay for celiac disease.",
        "Abstract": "Tissue transglutaminase is the autoantigen recognized by the sera of celiac patients. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on guinea-pig tissue transglutaminase was recently used to measure serum tissue transglutaminase antibodies for the diagnosis of celiac disease. We determine the sensitivity and specificity of an ELISA test based on the use of human recombinant transglutaminase, compared with the guinea pig transglutaminase ELISA and IgA antiendomysium antibodies. Serum samples were tested from 65 patients with intestinal biopsy proven celiac disease, from 10 patients with Crohn's disease, and from 150 healthy blood donors. Human transglutaminase ELISA identified 64 of 65 celiac patients, whereas the guinea pig transglutaminase ELISA and IgA antiendomysium antibodies identified 58 of 65 and 60 of 65 subjects, respectively. The three tests showed comparable specificity. These results proved that the human tissue transglutaminase-based ELISA represents a cost-effective strategy for identifying both symptomatic and atypical forms of celiac disease and could mean that intestinal biopsy need no longer be the gold standard for diagnosing this clinical condition. Furthermore, early identification and treatment of patients with celiac disease in an outpatient setting could have significant implications for reducing long-term morbidity and can produce major savings in future health care costs.",

        "Abstract": "Immunohistochemistry has been critical in determining the tissue localization of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). However, this technique suffers from nonspecific staining which may lead to false-positive results and the failure of antisera to recognize iNOS from different species. We developed a technique to determine the localization of iNOS mRNA, as opposed to protein, in tissue sections using an in situ RT-PCR (IS RT-PCR) technique. Sections of inflamed gastrointestinal mucosa were used because they were known to be positive for iNOS. The IS RT-PCR technique localized iNOS mRNA to the same sites as immunoreactive iNOS in human gastritis associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, Crohn's disease, and experimental inflammatory bowel disease induced by the hapten TNBS, in rat colon and in guinea pig ileum. The detection of mRNA had an excellent signal-to-noise ratio. Preservation of tissue morphology was poorer than that with immunohistochemistry due the cycles of heating required in the PCR process. This method could be very useful in detecting iNOS gene expression in situations of excessive nonspecific staining with immunohistochemistry or of failure of antibodies to react because of species differences. This technique is also readily applicable to detect RNA and DNA markers of other disease processes.",

        "Title": "Nitric oxide as a modulator of intestinal water and electrolyte transport.",
        "Abstract": "The role of nitric oxide in intestinal fluid and electrolyte secretion depends upon whether the conditions under study are physiological or pathophysiological. In physiological conditions, endogenous nitric oxide seems to be a proabsorptive molecule, based on the findings that nitric oxide synthase inhibitors reverse net fluid absorption to net secretion in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and dogs. This proabsorptive mode involves the enteric nervous system, the suppression of prostaglandin formation, and the opening of basolateral K+ channels. However, in some pathophysiological states nitric oxide synthase may be produced at higher concentrations that are capable of evoking net secretion. Thus nitric oxide synthase contributes to the diarrheal response in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced ileitis in guinea pigs and is the mediator of the laxative action of several intestinal secretagogues including castor oil, phenolphthalein, bisacodyl, magnesium sulfate, bile salts, senna, and cascara in the rat. Corresponding with the in vivo results, nitric oxide-donating compounds or nitric oxide itself stimulate chloride secretion in the guinea pig and rat intestine in vitro. Exceptions are the diarrhea produced by bacterial enterotoxins in the rat, in which nitric oxide seems to have a proabsorptive role, and the mouse ileum in vitro, in which nitric oxide-donating compounds produce a net proabsorptive effect on basal ion transport. Several endogenous secretagogues (substance P, 5-hydroxytryptamine, interleukin-1beta), which are important mediators of the inflammatory bowel diseases, act, at least in part, through the liberation of nitric oxide. Clinical studies have shown that nitric oxide is elevated in several inflammatory bowel diseases and other secretory conditions including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, toxic megacolon, diverticulitis, infectious gastroenteritis, and infantile methemoglobinemia. However, the determination of nitric oxide in secretory diarrhea per se does not give conclusive information on the nitric oxide contribution to clinical secretory diarrhea.",

        "Abstract": "1. Since intermittent ischaemia may play an important role in the aetiology of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, particularly Crohn's Disease, a pharmacological model of neuronal ischaemia was applied to guinea-pig isolated intestinal preparations to mimic the acute effects of reduced blood flow on intestinal motility. 2. Neuro-effector transmission and smooth muscle performance were examined in myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle preparations of guinea-pig ileum exposed to sodium cyanide (NaCN), in order to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation, or to iodoacetic acid (IAA), to block glycolysis. Comparisons were made with the effects due to simple deprivation of oxygen or glucose. 3. Depression of cholinergic neuro-effector transmission induced by hypoxia or NaCN (effective concentration range 0.1-3 mM), given as separate treatments, singly or repetitively over 60-90 min, were apparent within 30 s and were reversible. The maximum inhibition was 90% and the IC50 for NaCN was 0.3 mM. A conspicuous component of these inhibitions was prejunctional. 4. Non-cholinergic neuro-effector contractions were inhibited by up to 90% by anoxia or NaCN but recovery was incomplete and slower than with cholinergic contractions. 5. Glucose-free solutions also caused a reversible failure of cholinergic neuro-effector transmission but of slower onset. In contrast, IAA (0.06-1 mM) abolished contractions irreversibly, apparently by a direct depressant effect on smooth muscle contraction. Unlike NaCN, IAA caused an initial potentiation of electrically-induced contractions, partly by a prejunctional potentiation of cholinergic neuro-effector transmission. 6. It is concluded that a disruption of intestinal activity in pathological conditions associated with intestinal ischaemia may result from disturbances in the function of enteric neurones.",

        "Title": "An in vitro Model for Studying Mechanisms Underlying Synoviocyte-Mediated Cartilage Invasion in Rheumatoid Arthritis.",
        "Abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of joints involving the pathological development of an invasive and destructive pannus tissue which contributes to the loss of cartilage and bone. To further analyze the process of cartilage degradation and invasion, we have developed an in vitro model composed of cartilage matrix and synoviocytes (isolated from RA pannus tissue, as well as normal synovial membrane). The matrix is derived from pig articular cartilage and contains collagen type II and proteoglycans and is similar in composition to human cartilage. Data generated from this model reveal that synoviocytes isolated from RA pannus tissue invaded cartilage matrix in a manner which directly correlated with the severity of the disease. Analysis of mechanisms associated with the invasive process demonstrate that highly invasive RA synoviocytes maintain a round morphology during attachment and spreading on cartilage matrix, compared with their normal counterparts. Furthermore, the level of secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity was shown to correlate with the RA phenotype, which could be modulated with a novel MMP inhibitor. Normal synoviocytes could be \"converted\" to an RA phenotype by specific inflammatory cytokines, such that invasion of cartilage matrix was augmented by culturing these cells in the presence of 5 U/ml IL-1b or 18 U/ml TGFb. Invasion was inhibited by 150 U/ml TNFa, and unaffected by 100 ng/ml PDGF. In addition, synovial fluid from RA patients induced invasion of normal synoviocytes, in a concentration dependent manner, from 150% to 460%; however, synovial fluid from another inflammatory arthritidy (Crohn's) did not augment invasion to the same degree. Moreover, this \"conversion effect\" appears to be specific for synoviocytes, since similar effects could not be achieved with human skin fibroblasts. This in vitro model of synoviocyte-mediated cartilage invasion allows for further molecular characterization of the invasive properties of the synoviocyte which contribute to RA.",

Five of six animals sensitised with BCG showed positive responses at the ileal Kveim test site whereas all six had negative cutaneous Kveim tests. Conversely, two of six animals sensitised with irradiated Mycobacterium leprae showed positive cutaneous Kveim tests and only one a positive response in the ascending colon. All six showed negative responses at the ileal Kveim test site. No positive visceral or cutaneous responses were observed in either group of animals after tests with normal spleen suspension. These findings are discussed in relation to the positive Kveim responses previously reported among patients with Crohn's disease, tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy, and among seemingly healthy BCG vaccinated subjects.

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Leukotriene B4 is thought to be a prominent proinflammatory mediator in these diseases, in that leukotriene B4 levels are increased in the colonic mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease patients and there is increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration of these tissues. We evaluated the efficacy of 7-[3-(4-acetyl-3-methoxy-2-propylphenoxy)-3,4-dihydro-8-propyl -2H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylic acid (SC-41930), a potent, orally active leukotriene B4 receptor antagonist, in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. Colonic mucosal inflammation was induced in rats, guinea pig and rabbits by rectal instillation of a dilute solution of acetic acid. Twenty-four hours later, mucosal levels of myeloperoxidase (a marker enzyme for neutrophil infiltration) and extravasation of i.v. administered Evans blue dye (a marker of vascular disruption and increased permeability) were measured. Tissues were also evaluated histologically. The animals received either SC-41930 or vehicle, intrarectally, 30 min after or 1 hr before and 1 hr after the acetic acid. When given 30 min after acetic acid instillation SC-41930 prevented the rise in myeloperoxidase and dye extravasation observed in the acetic acid inflammed tissue. The SC-41930-treated tissues were less edematous and had fewer neutrophils within the subepithelial space. Median effective dose (ED50) values for vascular protection were approximately 20 mg/kg for both rat and guinea pig. ED50 values for inhibition of granulocyte accumulation were 20 mg/kg for rat, 24 mg/kg for guinea pig and 30 mg/kg for rabbit. These data indicate that SC-41930 is effective locally to prevent acute colonic inflammation.",

        "Abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine the effect of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cyclosporin A on a model of granulomatous infiltration in the terminal ileum and draining lymph nodes of the guinea pig. Treatment groups of six animals were used and compared to untreated groups of 12. Epithelioid cell granulomas and primary macrophage granulomas were induced by the inoculation of BCG (Pasteur) and irradiated Mycobacterium leprae respectively into the terminal ileum of the guinea pig. The response to purified protein derivative of tuberculin was reduced in both groups of animals receiving any of these agents. Cyclophosphamide and methotrexate treated animals inoculated with BCG or M leprae showed a significant reduction of granulomatous infiltration at the inoculation site (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.001 respectively). BCG inoculated animals treated with either hydrocortisone or cyclosporin A showed no reduction in granulomatous infiltration at either the inoculation site or the draining lymph nodes. By contrast M leprae inoculated animals receiving either of these agents showed a significant reduction of granulomatous infiltration at both the inoculation site (p less than 0.001) and in the primary draining lymph node (p less than 0.001). Ziehl Neelsen staining showed an increased proportion of animals with detectable acid fast bacilli (AFB) at the inoculation site in the groups receiving hydrocortisone (50%) and methotrexate (67%) compared to untreated controls (8%). No AFB were observed in any of the animals inoculated with M leprae. In conclusion, this model may be helpful in elucidating the mechanism of T lymphocyte response in Crohn's disease and the variable clinical response seen with the use of immunosuppressive agents in this condition.",

Live BCG (Pasteur) 2 x 10(7) at two weeks induced epithelioid cell granulomas in both large and small bowel and in the draining lymph nodes. The area of infiltration was significantly greater for a given inoculum in the large bowel. Acid fast bacilli were present on Ziehl Neelson stained sections of the large bowel infiltrate, but only rarely in sections from the small bowel lesions. The response to skin testing with a standardised amount of purified protein derivative was less in animals inoculated in the small bowel. Inoculation with 2 x 10(9) cobalt irradiated BCG gave rise, at five weeks, to granulomas containing lesser numbers of epithelioid cells and caseation was sometimes evident. There was a similar but smaller difference in the degree of infiltration at the two inoculation sites. Ziehl Neelson staining failed to reveal the presence of acid fast bacilli in any sections of the bowel infiltrates. Skin testing with purified protein derivative gave a response which was greater in animals inoculated in the small bowel. An identical dose of Cobalt irradiated M leprae induced at five weeks a predominantly macrophage granuloma in both the large and small bowel, with no significant difference in the degree of infiltration at the two sites. No acid fast bacilli were seen in Ziehl Neelson stained sections of the bowel and skin testing with purified protein derivative was reduced.

        "Title": "Production and secretion of immunoglobulins in the gastrointestinal tract.",
        "Abstract": "Two decades ago it was shown that the major immunoglobulin (Ig) present in human secretions is a dimeric IgA covalently bound to an epithelial glycoprotein of about 80 kD, now called the secretory component (SC). Pentameric IgM is likewise actively enriched in most exocrine fluids and is associated with SC, although not in a covalently stabilized complex. Three findings explain the selective translocation of polymeric Ig (pIg) into exocrine fluids: (1) preferential local production; (2) J-chain-expressing capacity of pIg-producing immunocytes; and (3) SC-mediated epithelial transport. Human hepatocytes lack SC and the human liver, therefore, cannot act as an efficient \"IgA pump\". This is in contrast to the rat liver which shows a remarkable capacity for transport of dimeric IgA from blood into the bile. The J chain of pIg and the epithelial SC represent the \"lock and key\" in the glandular transport of secretory IgA (SIgA) and SIgM. It has recently been shown that SC is synthesized as a transmembrane protein of about 95 kD and constitutes the actual pIg surface receptor. Complexing between ligand and receptor in the plasma membrane is followed by endocytosis. The completed SIgA and SIgM molecules are then translocated in cytoplasmic vesicles through the epithelial cell to the gland lumen along with an excess of free SC. The main function of SIgA is to exert immune exclusion; that is, by intimate cooperation with innate nonspecific defense factors it decreases penetration of soluble antigens and inhibits epithelial colonization of bacteria and viruses. Especially in selective IgA deficiency, SIgM may exert a similar protective function since its synthesis is markedly increased in the intestinal mucosa. Leakage of IgG into exocrine fluids is enhanced by mucosal irritation. Although IgG should not be considered as a SIg, it may contribute to immune exclusion. This is seen especially in the respiratory tract where IgG is less easily subjected to proteolytic degradation than in the intestinal juice. In contrast, by activating complement, IgG antibodies may at the same time be phlogistic and accelerate mucosal penetration of antigens. IgG may thus contribute to persistent immunopathology in mucosal disease. The same is true for IgE antibodies which may be carried into mucous membranes and secretions by mast cells and cause their degranulation with local histamine release. Traces of IgD may likewise be found in the secretions but without obvious biologic significance. Regulation of secretory immunity takes place both in organized lymphoepithelial structures, such as the Peyer's patches, and adjacent to the glands in the lamina propria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Formation of leukotrienes was demonstrated using radioimmunoassay, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and bioassay. Under basal conditions the gastrointestinal tissues released minor amounts of leukotrienes only. Formation of lipoxygenase-derived products of arachidonic acid metabolism was, however, significantly increased in the presence of various stimuli. Thus, significant amounts of LTB4 and of sulfidopeptide-leukotrienes were released from colonic and gastric mucosa of guinea-pigs sensitized against ovalbumin when incubations were carried out in the presence of antigen. Antigen-induced leukotriene formation was not found in the muscularis propria and subserosal of ovalbumin-sensitized guinea-pigs. Release of cyclooxygenase-derived metabolites of arachidonic acid, on the other hand, was most abundant in the subserosal layer of the guinea-pig colon and was not influenced by the immunological reaction. Inhibitors of cyclooxygenase, such as indomethacin, reduced gastrointestinal formation of prostaglandins, but not of leukotrienes. Inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase, however, significantly decreased leukotriene formation. Synthesis of LTB4 and of sulfidopeptide-leukotrienes was also found in human colonic mucosal tissue, using the divalent cation-ionophore A23187 as stimulating agent. HPLC analysis demonstrated that the sulfidopeptide-leukotrienes released were composed of a mixture of LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4. In addition, human colonic mucosal tissue contained high activities of enzymes that rapidly convert LTC4 to LTE4. As in most biological systems LTE4 is less active than LTC4 and LTD4 degrading enzymes might represent a local inactivating mechanism. Mucosal tissue of patients with Crohn's disease synthesized considerably more LTB4 and sulfidopeptide-leukotrienes than non-inflamed mucosa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Interestingly, despite a variety of different animal species and a broad range of inducing agents, the response of the large intestine has been somewhat predictable. Although there is suggestive evidence for transmissible agents in several of these animal model systems, documentation of a bacterial or viral etiology has remained elusive. Perhaps the best evidence to suggest that bacteria play a role in the development of naturally occurring ulcerative colitis resides in the studies utilizing the rabbit-dinitrochlorobenzine model and the carrageenin-induced ulcerative colitis model in the guinea pig. The evidence for microbial involvement in these model systems includes the use of single bacterial species in the carrageenin model to produce an ulcerative colitis like disease and the use of antimicrobial agents to alter the experimental model system in the guinea pig and hamster with proliferative ileitis and evidence of transmissibility. Recent reports of transmissible agents for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in studies utilizing immunologically deficient mice also suggest that the search for the \"agent\" and mechanism should continue in model systems. The many differences between animal model systems and the human disease cannot be ignored. These differences make establishing what appears to be a complicated etiology even more difficult. Despite the difference in anatomy, physiology, and nutritional factors between animal model systems and the human disease process, the fact remains that one or more of these model systems may reflect the same mechanism or etiologic agent which occurs in the human disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Title": "Abdominal tuberculosis: demonstration of tubercle bacilli in tissues and experimental production of hyperplastic enteric lesions.",
        "Abstract": "Material obtained from 35 cases of abdominal tuberculosis waps studied and an attempt was made to demonstrate tubercle bacilli by special staining of histological sections, culture and guinea-pig inoculation. Acid fast bacilli could be demonstrated in 80 per cent of cases. The remaining cases were also possibly due to tuberculous infection because granulomas with Langhans's type of giant cells and caseation or calcification of lymph nodes were present. The bacilli were demonstrated in bowel tissue showing non-specific histology in 1 case. In 2 other cases with non-specific lesions in the bowel the bacilli were demonstrated in lymph nodes. Guinea-pig inoculation studies showed that hypertrophic lesions of the bowel with a non-specific type of reaction could develop after intraperitoneal injection of tubercular material. Although it cannot be said on the basis of this study that Crohn's disease is caused by tuberculous infection, it can be concluded that tuberculous infection can give rise to a Crohn's type of lesion.",

        "Abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that mediates the homeostasis of immune responses; its exacerbated production is associated with the pathogenesis of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. Anti-TNF\u03b1 drugs have revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Currently, a worldwide race is on stage for the production of biosimilars moved by patent expiration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as anti-TNF\u03b1 adalimumab. Our goal was to develop the first stage of an adalimumab biosimilar candidate with potential for national production, through the generation of a productive and stable cell line and assess its functionality. The robotic system ClonePix was used for screening and isolation of colonies from transfected CHO-S stable pools plated in semisolid medium. Selected clones were expanded based on growth and productivity. Purified mAbs from different clones were tested for binding and functional activity. The binding affinity of the denominated adabut clones to TNF\u03b1 and FcR\u03b3 did not differ statistically when compared to reference adalimumab. One functional activity assay demonstrated the antibody neutralization capacity of the cytotoxicity induced by TNF\u03b1 in L929 murine fibroblasts. A second assay confirmed adabut as an antagonist of the TNF\u03b1 activity by the inhibition of the cell adhesion molecule expression in HUVEC cultures. The binding and functional activity analyses performed with selected adabut clones in comparison to reference adalimumab represent an important status of \"non-inferiority,\" part of the process required for a biosimilar development. We generated and selected high-quality adabut clones which mAbs may be further developed as the first in-house made Brazilian biosimilar, demonstrating a success case for our incipient biotechnology industry, or also modified as biobetters, thus representing an innovative strategy for the patients' welfare.",

        "Abstract": "The chemokine fractalkine (CX3C chemokine ligand 1; CX3CL1) and its receptor CX3CR1 are involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, myositis, multiple sclerosis, renal ischemia, and atherosclerosis. There are no orally available agents that modulate the fractalkine/CX3CR1 axis. [(3<i>S</i>,4<i>R</i>)-1-[2-Chloro-6-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl]-3-{[1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-ylmethyl)piperidin-4-yl]carbamoyl}-4-methylpyrrolidin-3-yl]acetic acid (2S)-hydroxy(phenyl)acetate (E6130) is an orally available highly selective modulator of CX3CR1 that may be effective for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. We found that E6130 inhibited the fractalkine-induced chemotaxis of human peripheral blood natural killer cells (IC<sub>50</sub> 4.9 nM), most likely via E6130-induced down-regulation of CX3CR1 on the cell surface. E6130 had agonistic activity via CX3CR1 with respect to guanosine 5'-3-<i>O</i>-(thio)triphosphate binding in CX3CR1-expressing Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO-K1) membrane and had no antagonistic activity. Orally administered E6130 ameliorated several inflammatory bowel disease-related parameters in a murine CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T-cell-transfer colitis model and a murine oxazolone-induced colitis model. In the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T-cell transfer model, E6130 inhibited the migration of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> immune cells and decreased the number of these cells in the gut mucosal membrane. These results suggest that E6130 is a promising therapeutic agent for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "Title": "Interleukin-11.",
        "Abstract": "Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a cytokine which interacts with a variety of haemopoietic and non-haemopoietic cell types. Recombinant human IL-11 (rhIL-11; oprelvekin) is produced in Escherichia coli and differs from the naturally occurring protein only in the absence of the amino-terminal proline residue. In synergy with other factors, rhIL-11 stimulates the growth of myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocyte progenitor cells in vitro. In vivo, rhIL-11 is active in mice, rats, dogs, guinea pigs, hamsters and non-human primates, where the principal activity measured was stimulation of megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. rhIL-11 has shown benefit in 2 clinical trials by significantly reducing severe chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. In addition to its thrombopoietic activity, rhIL-11 has also shown activity in models of acute gastrointestinal mucosal damage. rhIL-11 enhanced survival in mice following cytoablative therapy and in a hamster model of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis, where treatment with rhIL-11 was associated with decreased mucosal damage, accelerated healing and reduced numbers of deaths. rhIL-11 is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. In rat models of acute colonic injury and inflammatory bowel disease, rhIL-11 treatment reduced intestinal mucosal damage and alleviated clinical signs. rhIL-11 has direct effects on activated macrophages to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. In animal models of endotoxaemia, rhIL-11 treatment reduced serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and blocked hypotension. rhIL-11 increased survival in models of Gram-negative sepsis and toxic shock. Based on these studies, rhIL-11 is currently in clinical trials for treatment of Crohn's disease. Other inflammatory conditions are being further evaluated. Mechanistically, rhIL-11 functions at many levels to control inflammation, ameliorate tissue damage and maintain haemostasis in the face of trauma or infection. rhIL-11 has direct effects on hepatocytes, inducing the production of acute phase reactant proteins, haem oxygenase and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). TIMP-1 expression can also be induced in synoviocytes and chondrocytes by treatment with rhIL-11. rhIL-11 administration has been associated with increased plasma levels of von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen. rhIL-11 treatment potentially offers multiple benefits for cancer chemotherapy patients, such as prevention of thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal epithelial protection and subsequent reduction of mucositis, and amelioration of inflammatory complications. In addition, rhIL-11 is being evaluated further in the treatment of inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis.",

        "Abstract": "Mycobacterium paratuberculosis has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). The importance of microorganisms in CD is supported by the association of CD with mutations in the intracellular pathogen recognition receptor (PRR) nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2). The aim of this study is to investigate the PRR involved in the recognition of M. paratuberculosis. Methods used include in vitro stimulation of transfected cell lines, murine macrophages, and human PBMC. M. paratuberculosis stimulated human TLR2 (hTLR2)-Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells predominantly and hTLR4-CHO cells modestly. Macrophages from TLR2 and TLR4 knockout mice produced less cytokines compared with controls after stimulation with M. paratuberculosis. TLR4 inhibition in human PBMC reduced cytokine production only after stimulation with live M. paratuberculosis. TLR-induced TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-10 production is mediated through MyD88, whereas Toll-IL-1R domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta (TRIF) promoted the release of IL-1beta. hNOD2-human embryo kidney (HEK) cells, but not hNOD1-HEK cells, responded to stimulation with M. paratuberculosis. PBMC of individuals homozygous for the 3020insC NOD2 mutation showed a 70% defective cytokine response after stimulation with M. paratuberculosis. These results demonstrate that TLR2, TLR4, and NOD2 are involved in the recognition of M. paratuberculosis by the innate immune system.",

        "Abstract": "Crohn disease is immunologically mediated and characterized by intestinal and systemic chronic inflammation. In a rat model, injection of peptidoglycan-polysaccharide complexes into the intestinal wall induced chronic inflammation in Lewis but neither Fischer nor Buffalo rats, indicating a differential genetic susceptibility. Proteolysis of plasma high molecular weight kininogen (HK) yielding bradykinin and cleaved HK (HKa) was faster in Lewis than in Fischer or Buffalo rat plasma. A single point mutation at nucleotide 1586 was found translating from Ser511 (Buffalo and Fisher) to Asn511 (Lewis). The latter defines an Asn-Xaa-Thr consensus sequence for N-glycosylation. We expressed these domains in Escherichia coli and found no differences in the rate of cleavage by purified kallikrein in the 3 strains in the absence of N-glycosylation. We then expressed these domains in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which are capable of glycosylation, and found an increased rate of cleavage of Lewis HK. The Lewis mutation is associated with N-glycosylation as evidenced by a more rapid migration after treatment with N-glycosidase F. When CHO cells were cultured in the presence of tunicamycin, the kallikrein-induced cleavage rate of Lewis HK was not increased. This molecular alteration might be one contributing factor resulting in chronic inflammation in Lewis rats.",

        "Title": "NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Salicylazosulfapyridine (CAS No. 599-79-1) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Gavage Studies).",
        "Abstract": "Salicylazosulfapyridine is widely used for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It has been beneficial in the treatment of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and it has been used in veterinary medicine for the treatment of granulomatous colitis. Salicylazosulfapyridine was nominated for toxicity and carcinogenicity testing by the National Cancer Institute on the basis of its widespread use in humans and because it is a representative chemical from a class of aryl sulfonamides. Salicylazosulfapyridine is a suspect carcinogen because reductive cleavage of the azo linkage yields a p-amino aryl sulfonamide (sulfapyridine), and a related p-amino aryl sulfonamide (sulfamethoxazole) has been shown to produce thyroid neoplasms in rats. Toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. Rats and mice were administered salicylazosulfapyridine (96% to 98% pure) in corn oil by gavage for 16 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. The gavage route of administration was selected for these studies because it approximates the typical route of human exposure to the chemical. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in vitro in Salmonella typhimurium and cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells and in vivo in rat and mouse bone marrow and mouse peripheral blood cells. 16-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female rats were administered 0, 675, 1,350, or 2,700 mg salicylazosulfapyridine/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage for 16 days excluding weekends. All rats survived to the end of the study. With the exception of the 675 mg/kg male group, the final mean body weights of all dosed groups of males and females were significantly lower than those of controls. Mean body weight gains of all dosed groups were less than those of controls. Clinical findings included ruffled fur and distended abdomens in male and female rats receiving 2,700 mg/kg. Hypothyroidism, evidenced by decreased serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations and increased thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations, occurred in 2,700 mg/kg male and female rats. The absolute and relative thymus weights of male rats receiving,350 or 2,700 mg/kg and female rats receiving 2,700 mg/kg were significantly lower than those of controls. At necropsy, all dosed rats had enlarged cecae/large intestines. Male rats receiving 1,350 mg/kg and male and female rats receiving 2,700 mg/kg had red, enlarged thyroid glands. Chemical-related microscopic lesions were present in the forestomach, thymus, thyroid gland, and pituitary gland. Minimal to mild hyperplasia of the forestomach mucosa was present in the 1,350 and 2,700 mg/kg male and female groups. Lymphoid depletion was observed in the thymus of three male and three female rats in the 2,700 mg/kg groups. Male and female rats receiving 1,350 and 2,700 mg/kg had thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia and an increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone producing cells in the pars distalis of the pituitary gland. 16-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female mice were administered 0, 675, 1,350, or 2,700 mg salicylazosulfapyridine/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage for 16 days excluding weekends. There were no chemical-related deaths, and final mean body weights of dosed mice were similar to those of controls. No chemical-related clinical findings were noted for male or female mice. There were no differences in triiodothyronine, thyroxine, or thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations between dosed and control mice. There were no biologically significant differences in absolute or relative organ weights between dosed and control male and female mice. At necropsy, male mice receiving 2,700 mg/kg had enlarged cecae/large intestines. There were no biologically significant histopathologic lesions attributed to salicylazosulfapyridine administration. 13-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were administered 0, 84, 168.8, or 337.5 mg salicylazosulfapyridine/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage for 13 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study. The finaludy. The final mean body weights of dosed male rats were similar to those of controls; the final mean body weights and body weight gains of dosed females were significantly lower than those of controls. No chemical-related clinical findings were noted in dosed male or female rats during the 13-week study. No significant differences in hematology or urinalysis parameters between control and dosed rats were observed. The absolute and relative right kidney weights of 337.5 mg/kg females were significantly greater than those of controls. At necropsy, some 337.5 mg/kg male rats had red, enlarged thyroid glands. Histopathologic changes were noted primarily in the thyroid gland and pituitary gland of males and females in the 337.5 mg/kg groups. The thyroid gland lesions observed were similar to those present in the 16-day study. Nine male rats receiving 168.8 mg/kg and ten male and seven female rats receiving.5 mg/kg had minimal but consistent changes in thyroid gland follicular cells. In the pituitary gland of 337.5 mg/kg males and females, the thyroid-stimulating hormone producing cells were enlarged and contained pale-staining cytoplasm and prominent Golgi complexes. Decreased serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations and increased thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration, similar to differences observed in the 16-day study, occurred in 337.5 mg/kg male rats; thyroid hormone concentrations were not affected in female rats. Sperm motility of all dosed groups of males was significantly lower than that of controls. Vaginal cytology parameters of dosed groups of females were similar to those of controls. 13-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were administered 0, 675, 1,350, or 2,700 mg salicylazosulfapyridine/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage for 13 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. The final mean body weights of dosed male and female mice were similar to those of controls. The mean body weight gains of 1,350 and 2,700 mg/kg male mice were less than that of controls. No chemical-related clinical findings were noted in dosed male or female mice during the 13-week study. There was minimal evidence of a responsive anemia in mice in the 13-week study. The anemia was probably related to a methemoglobinemia. There were minimal decreases in thyroxine concentration in all dosed groups of male and female mice in the -week study. There were, however, no differences in triiodothyronine and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations between dosed and control animals. Absolute and relative liver weights of all groups of dosed male and female mice were significantly greater than those of controls. There were no chemical-related gross lesions. Microscopic evaluation of the liver revealed centrilobular hypertrophy in five 1,350 mg/kg and all 2,700 mg/kg male mice. The right cauda weight of the 1,350 mg/kg group and the right epididymis weights of all dose groups were significantly lower than those of controls. There was no evidence of chemical-related alteration in the vaginal cytology parameters of female mice. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 60 male and 60 female rats were administered 84, 168, or 337.5 mg salicylazosulfapyridine/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage for up to 105 weeks. Groups of 70 male and 60 female rats were administered the corn oil vehicle by gavage for up to 105 weeks. A stop-exposure group of 70 male rats was administered 337.5 mg/kg salicylazosulfapyridine in corn oil by gavage for 6 months, after which animals received the corn oil vehicle by gavage for the remainder of the 2-year study. Ten animals from the vehicle control male group and 10 animals from the 337.5 mg/kg stop-exposure group were evaluated at 6 months; animals from each core-study group were evaluated at 15 months. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Chemistry: Survival of 337.5 mg/kg male core-study rats was significantly lower than that of controls; survival of 84 and 168 mg/kg core-study males, all groups of dosed females, and the stop-exposure male group was similar to controls. Mean body weights of core-study males and stop-exposure males were similar to controls throughout the study. From week 45 to the end of the study, females in the 337.5 mg/kg group had mean body weights that were lower than those of controls. The serum thyroxine concentration in 337.5 mg/kg core-study males at study termination was minimally lower than that of controls; the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone, triiodothyronine, and reverse triiodothyronine concentrations of dosed males and females were similar to those of controls. Pathology Findings: Administration of salicylazosulfapyridine for 2 years was associated with transitional epithelial papilloma in the urinary bladder of male rats and may have been associated with transitional epithelial papilloma of the kidney and of the urinary bladder of female rats. Nonneoplastic effects in the urinary bladder and kidney of male and female rats and in the spleen of male rats were also observed. Dosed male and female rats had increased incidences of grossly and microscopically observed urinary bladder concretions (diagnosed grossly as calculi at necropsy); male and female rats that developed transitional epithelial papillomas of the urinary bladder had grossly observed concretions (calculi) in the urinary bladder at necropsy. The microscopic neoplastic and nonneoplastic urinary bladder and kidney effects observed in dosed male rats during the 2-year continuous study did not occur in dosed rats during the 2-year stop-exposure study, nor were there gross observations of concretions (calculi) at necropsy. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats were decreased. The thyroid gland hyperplasia seen in the -week study was not observed in the 2-year study, and there was no evidence of chemical-related thyroid gland follicular cell adenomas or carcinomas. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 60 male and 60 female mice were administered 0, 675, 1,350, or 2,700 mg salicylazosulfapyridine/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage for up to 104 weeks. Ten animals from each group were evaluated at 15 months. Survival, Body Weights,and Clinical Chemistry: Survival of all the dosed groups of male and female mice was similar to that of controls. Mean body weights of 675 and 1,350 mg/kg male and female mice were similar to controls throughout the study. From week 12 to the end of the study, 2,700 mg/kg male mice had mean body weights that were lower than those of controls. From week 14 to the end of the study, the 2,700 mg/kg female mice had mean body weights that were lower than those of controls. There were no chemical-related differences in triiodothyronine, reverse triiodothyronine, thyroxine, or thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations between dosed and control mice at the 15-month evaluation. Pathology Findings: Exposure of mice to salicylazosulfapyridine in corn oil by gavage for 2 years was associated with increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms in males and females. Nonneoplastic effects in the liver and spleen were also observed in male and female mice. The incidences of forestomach squamous cell papilloma in females and forestomach hyperplasia in males and females were decreased. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Salicylazosulfapyridine was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, or TA1535, and it did not induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. These in vitro assays were performed with and without S9 metabolic activation enzymes. Results from in vivo mouse bone marrow chromo somal aberration tests were uniformly negative, while results of micronucleus assays performed on male or female mice exposed to salicylazosulfapyridine for periods ranging from 3 days to weeks were positive. Micronucleus tests in male mice for shorter exposure times (1 to 2 days) yielded negative or very weakly positive results. A three-treatment (72-hour exposure time) micronucleus test performed in male rats yielded equivocal results. Overall, results of these in vivo assays indicate that salicylazosulfa pyridine is capable of inducing chromosomal damage, possibly in the form of aneuploidy, in mouse bone marrow cells after multiple administrations. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of salicylazosulfapyridine in male and female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of neoplasms in the urinary tract. There was an increased incidence of transitional epithelial papilloma of the urinary bladder in males and a low incidence of rare transitional epithelial papillomas of the kidney and of the urinary bladder in females. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of salicylazosulfapyridine in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms. Increased incidences of nonneoplastic lesions of the urinary bladder and kidney in male and female rats and of the spleen in male rats were observed. Increased incidences of nonneoplastic lesions of the liver and spleen in male and female mice were observed. Decreased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats were related to salicylazosulfapyridine administration. Decreased incidences of forestomach squamous cell papilloma in female mice and forestomach hyperplasia in male and female mice were related to salicylazosulfapyridine administration.

        "Abstract": "The ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter plays a critical role in the reabsorption of bile acids from the small intestine. In the course of cloning and characterizing the human ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter cDNA, a dysfunctional isoform was identified in a patient diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Expression studies using hamster-human ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter cDNA chimeras narrowed the location of the defect to the carboxyl-terminal 94 amino acids. Comparison of the sequence of the dysfunctional isoform to that of a wild-type human ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter genomic clone revealed a single C to T transition resulting in a proline to serine substitution at amino acid position 290. The inheritance of this mutation in the proband's family was confirmed by single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. In transfected COS-1 cells, the single amino acid change abolished taurocholate transport activity but did not alter the transporter's synthesis or subcellular distribution. This dysfunctional mutation represents the first known molecular defect in a human sodium-dependent bile acid transporter.",

        "Abstract": "Salicylazosulfapyridine, commonly known as sulfasalazine or SASP, is an anti-inflammatory drug that is widely used in the treatment of diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Increases in sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and micronuclei (MN) frequencies have been reported in lymphocytes of patients maintained on SASP therapy for up to 21 months. We have tested SASP for its ability to induce chromosome aberrations (ABS) and SCE in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, ABS in mouse bone marrow cells, and MN in erythrocytes from both bone marrow and peripheral blood of mice. In vitro assays for ABS and SCE were negative. In vivo, SASP administered by single gavage at doses up to 1000 mg/kg did not increase ABS in bone marrow cells of male B6C3F1 mice; however, increases in MN were observed in the peripheral blood erythrocytes of male and female B6C3F1 mice administered 675, 1350 or 2700 mg/kg SASP by gavage for 90 days. Weak but significant dose-related increases in MN were also observed in the bone marrow cells of male B6C3F1 mice administered 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg SASP for 3 days. These positive findings in mice support the role of SASP in the induction of MN and SCE in humans, and suggest the need for further evaluation of possible adverse human health effects associated with SASP therapy.",

        "Abstract": "Animal model systems have been used extensively to study both experimental and naturally occurring ulcerative colitis syndromes. Interestingly, despite a variety of different animal species and a broad range of inducing agents, the response of the large intestine has been somewhat predictable. Although there is suggestive evidence for transmissible agents in several of these animal model systems, documentation of a bacterial or viral etiology has remained elusive. Perhaps the best evidence to suggest that bacteria play a role in the development of naturally occurring ulcerative colitis resides in the studies utilizing the rabbit-dinitrochlorobenzine model and the carrageenin-induced ulcerative colitis model in the guinea pig. The evidence for microbial involvement in these model systems includes the use of single bacterial species in the carrageenin model to produce an ulcerative colitis like disease and the use of antimicrobial agents to alter the experimental model system in the guinea pig and hamster with proliferative ileitis and evidence of transmissibility. Recent reports of transmissible agents for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in studies utilizing immunologically deficient mice also suggest that the search for the \"agent\" and mechanism should continue in model systems. The many differences between animal model systems and the human disease cannot be ignored. These differences make establishing what appears to be a complicated etiology even more difficult. Despite the difference in anatomy, physiology, and nutritional factors between animal model systems and the human disease process, the fact remains that one or more of these model systems may reflect the same mechanism or etiologic agent which occurs in the human disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Abstract": "We have identified a decreased abundance of microbial species known to have a potential anti-inflammatory, protective effect in subjects that developed Celiac Disease (CeD) compared to those who did not. We aim to confirm the potential protective role of one of these species, namely Bacteroides vulgatus, and to mechanistically establish the effect of bacterial bioproducts on gluten-dependent changes on human gut epithelial functions. We identified, isolated, cultivated, and sequenced a unique novel strain (20220303-A2) of B. vulgatus found only in control subjects. Using a human gut organoid system developed from pre-celiac patients, we monitored epithelial phenotype and innate immune cytokines at baseline, after exposure to gliadin, or gliadin plus B. vulgatus cell free supernatant (CFS). Following gliadin exposure, we observed increases in epithelial cell death, epithelial monolayer permeability, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These effects were mitigated upon exposure to B. vulgatus 20220303-A2 CFS, which had matched phenotype gene product mutations. These protective effects were mediated by epigenetic reprogramming of the organoids treated with B. vulgatus CFS. We identified a unique strain of B. vulgatus that may exert a beneficial role by protecting CeD epithelium against a gluten-induced break of epithelial tolerance through miRNA reprogramming. Gut dysbiosis precedes the onset of celiac disease in genetically at-risk infants. This dysbiosis is characterized by the loss of protective bacterial strains in those children who will go on to develop celiac disease. The paper reports the mechanism by which one of these protective strains, B. vulgatus, ameliorates the gluten-induced break of gut epithelial homeostasis by epigenetically re-programming the target intestinal epithelium involving pathways controlling permeability, immune response, and cell turnover.",

        "Abstract": "Increased intestinal permeability seems to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including celiac disease (CeD). However, it is unknown whether increased permeability precedes CeD onset. This study's objective was to determine whether intestinal permeability is altered before celiac disease autoimmunity (CDA) in at-risk children. We also examined whether environmental factors impacted zonulin, a widely used marker of gut permeability. We evaluated 102 children in the CDGEMM study from 2014-2022. We included 51 CDA cases and matched controls, who were enrolled for 12 months or more and consumed gluten. We measured serum zonulin from age 12 months to time of CDA onset, and the corresponding time point in controls, and examined clinical factors of interest. We ran a mixed-effects longitudinal model with dependent variable zonulin. Children who developed CDA had a significant increase in zonulin in the 18.3 months (range 6-78) preceding CDA compared to those without CDA (slope differential = \u03b2 = 0.1277, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.255). Among metadata considered, zonulin trajectory was only influenced by increasing number of antibiotic courses, which increased the slope of trajectory of zonulin over time in CDA subjects (P = .04). Zonulin levels significantly rise in the months that precede CDA diagnosis. Exposure to a greater number of antibiotic courses was associated with an increase in zonulin levels in CDA subjects. This suggests zonulin may be used as a biomarker for preclinical CeD screening in at-risk children, and multiple antibiotic courses may increase their risk of CDA by increasing zonulin levels.",

        "Abstract": "The median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a rare disease caused by compression of the celiac artery (ORPHA: 293208). Surgical treatment of MALS aims to restore normal celiac blood flow by laparoscopic celiac artery decompression. However, surgical success rates vary widely between patients, therefore adequate selection of patients is essential to improve surgical outcome. Symptoms of MALS might also overlap with other chronic multi-system disorders such as mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). So far, no clinical or radiological parameter was found to be predictive of the postoperative outcome. We, therefore, aim to study preclinical parameters in one of the largest MALS cohorts with the focus to identify patients that would benefit from surgical MAL release. By analyzing 20 MALS patients that underwent surgical celiac artery decompression, we found 60% of patients (12/20) had a postoperative relief of their symptoms and a simultaneous decrease of analgetic use. No demographic, radiologic or operative parameter was able to predict postoperative symptom relief. However, mast cell activation syndrome correlated significantly (p\u2009=\u20090.04) with persistent symptoms after the operation. Overall, laparoscopic MAL release can provide immediate symptomatic relief. Despite the missing predictive value of demographic and imaging data, our data show a correlation between persistent symptoms and a co-existing mast cell activation syndrome. This suggests that MCAS symptoms might be interpreted as MALS symptoms in the presence of celiac artery stenosis and therefore surgical treatment should be evaluated carefully. Overall, the selection of patients who are most likely to respond to surgical MAL release may best be accomplished by an interdisciplinary team of gastroenterologists, radiologists and surgeons.",

        "Title": "A role for pathogenic autoantibodies in small fiber neuropathy?",
        "Abstract": "The immune system has a role in neuropathic pain which includes autoimmune mechanisms (e.g., autoantibodies). Clinical studies have identified a number of conditions where neuropathic pain is common and that are associated with autoantibodies targeting antigens within the nervous system. Interestingly sensory symptoms can be relieved with immunotherapies or plasma exchange, suggesting that pain in these patients is antibody-mediated. Recent preclinical studies have directly addressed this. For example, passive transfer of CASPR2 autoantibodies from patients cause increased pain sensitivity and enhanced sensory neuron excitability in mice confirming pathogenicity and demonstrating that patient autoantibodies are a mechanism to cause neuropathic pain. Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) exclusively affects small sensory fibers (typically nociceptors) and is characterized by severe neuropathic pain. Known causes include diabetes, B12 deficiency and rare variants in sodium channel genes, although around 50% of cases are idiopathic. SFN is associated with autoimmune conditions such as Sjorgen's syndrome, Sarcoidosis and Celiac disease and immunotherapy in the form of Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has proved an effective treatment. Autoantibodies have been identified and, in some cases, passive transfer of SFN patient IgG in mice can recapitulate neuropathic pain-like behavior. Here we will discuss clinical and preclinical data relating to the idea that pathogenic autoantibodies contribute to SNF. We discuss putative pathogenic antibodies, cellular targets and the molecular mechanisms by which they cause sensory neuron damage and the development of neuropathic pain. Finally, we will comment on future directions which may provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying SFN in patients.",

        "Abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and celiac disease are prevalent intestinal inflammatory disorders with nonsatisfactory therapeutic interventions. Analyzing patient data-driven cohorts can highlight disease pathways and new targets for interventions. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are attractive candidates, since they are readily targetable by RNA therapeutics, show relative cell-specific expression, and play key cellular functions. Uniformly analyzing gut mucosal transcriptomics from 696 subjects, we have highlighted lncRNA expression along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, demonstrating that, in control samples, lncRNAs have a more location-specific expression in comparison with protein-coding genes. We defined dysregulation of lncRNAs in treatment-naive UC, CD, and celiac diseases using independent test and validation cohorts. Using the Predicting Response to Standardized Pediatric Colitis Therapy (PROTECT) inception UC cohort, we defined and prioritized lncRNA linked with UC severity and prospective outcomes, and we highlighted lncRNAs linked with gut microbes previously implicated in mucosal homeostasis. HNF1A-AS1 lncRNA was reduced in all 3 conditions and was further reduced in more severe UC form. Similarly, the reduction of HNF1A-AS1 ortholog in mice gut epithelia showed higher sensitivity to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, which was coupled with alteration in the gut microbial community. These analyses highlight prioritized dysregulated lncRNAs that can guide future preclinical studies for testing them as potential targets.",

Here we efficiently generate tolerogenic dendritic cells by genetic engineering of monocytes with lentiviral vectors co-encoding for immunodominant antigen-derived peptides and IL-10. These transduced dendritic cells (designated DC<sup>IL-10/Ag</sup>) secrete IL-10 and efficiently downregulate antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses from healthy subjects and celiac disease patients in vitro. In addition, DC<sup>IL-10/Ag</sup> induce antigen-specific CD49b<sup>+</sup>LAG-3<sup>+</sup> T cells, which display the T regulatory type 1 (Tr1) cell gene signature. Administration of DC<sup>IL-10/Ag</sup> resulted in the induction of antigen-specific Tr1 cells in chimeric transplanted mice and the prevention of type 1 diabetes in pre-clinical disease models. Subsequent transfer of these antigen-specific T cells completely prevented type 1 diabetes development. Collectively these data indicate that DC<sup>IL-10/Ag</sup> represent a platform to induce stable antigen-specific tolerance to control T-cell mediated diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Studies of the role of iron in the risk of type 1 diabetes (T1D) have been inconsistent. Given that iron generates reactive oxygen radicals, which can lead to oxidative damage and apoptosis in the beta cells of the pancreas, we examined whether iron intake was associated with the risk of progressing to T1D in individuals with islet autoimmunity (IA), the pre-clinical phase of T1D. DAISY is a prospective cohort following 2,547 children at increased risk for IA and progression to T1D. IA is defined as at least two consecutive serum samples positive for at least one autoantibody (insulin, GAD, IA-2, or ZnT8). We measured dietary intake at the time of IA seroconversion in 175 children with IA, and of these, 64 progressed to T1D. We used Cox regression to examine the association between energy-adjusted iron intake and progression to T1D, adjusting for HLA-DR3/4 genotype, race/ethnicity, age at seroconversion, presence of multiple autoantibodies at seroconversion, and multiple vitamin use. In addition, we tested whether this association was modified by vitamin C or calcium intake. In children with IA, high iron intake (as defined as above the 75th percentile, > 20.3 mg/day) was associated with decreased risk of progression to T1D compared to moderate iron intake (as defined by the middle 25-75th percentiles, 12.7-20.3 mg/day) (adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.15, 0.79). The association between iron intake and T1D was not modified by vitamin C nor calcium intake. In a sensitivity analysis, the removal of six children who had been diagnosed with celiac disease prior to IA seroconversion did not affect this association. Higher iron intake at the time of IA seroconversion is associated with a lower risk of progression to T1D, independent of multivitamin supplement use. Further research that includes plasma biomarkers of iron status is needed to investigate the relationship between iron and the risk of T1D.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease related to gluten consumption. To date, the only effective therapy that can reverse symptoms and prevent complications is the gluten-free diet (GFD), which is challenging to maintain and has potential health risks. Identifying foods that can help diversify the GFD and that best match the nutritional needs of people with CD may improve the health and quality of life of celiac patients. This review, conducted through a non-systematic search of the available literature, aims to gather the most recent research on nutritional issues in CD and GFD. Moreover, it highlights how sorghum characteristics could provide health benefits to CD patients that counteract the nutritional problems due to CD and the nutritional consequences of GFD acceptance. Sorghum contains a wide variety of bioactive compounds, such as flavones and tannins, that have shown anti-inflammatory activity in preclinical studies. They can also regulate blood sugar levels and lower cholesterol to reduce the effects of common chronic diseases such as metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Because it is gluten-free, its use in making foods for celiac patients is increasing, especially in the United States. In conclusion, sorghum is a fascinating grain with nutritional properties and health benefits for supplementing GFD. However, only one study confirms the short-term safety of sorghum inclusion in the GFD, and further long-term studies with a large sample are needed.",

As the field moves towards development of new approaches to treat autoimmune disease, antigen-specific therapies immunotherapies (ASITs) have emerged. Despite clinical approval of ASITs for allergies, clinical trials using soluble ASITs for autoimmunity have been largely unsuccessful. A major effort to address this shortcoming is the use of biomaterials to harness the features unique to specific delivery routes. This review focuses on biomaterials being developed for delivery route-specific strategies to induce antigen-specific responses in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and celiac disease. We first discuss the delivery strategies used in ongoing and completed clinical trials in autoimmune ASITs. Next, we highlight pre-clinical biomaterial approaches from the most recent 3 years in the context of these same delivery route considerations. Lastly, we provide discussion on the gaps remaining in biomaterials development and comment on the need to consider delivery routes in the process of designing biomaterials for ASITs.",

        "Abstract": "Cannulation of visceral vessels is necessary during fenestrated and branched endovascular aortic repair. In an attempt to reduce the associated radiation and contrast dose, an electromagnetically (EM) trackable and manually steerable catheter has been developed. The purpose of this preclinical swine study was to evaluate the cannulation performance and compare the cannulation performance using either EM tracking or image fusion as navigation tools. Both renal arteries, the superior mesenteric artery, and the celiac trunk were attempted to be cannulated using a 7F steerable, EM trackable catheter in 3 pigs. Seven operators attempted cannulation using first 3-dimensional (3D) image navigation with EM tracking and then conventional image fusion guidance. The rate of successful cannulation was recorded, as well as procedure time and radiation exposure. Due to the lack of an EM trackable guidewire, cannulations that required more than 1 attempt were attempted only with image fusion. The EM tracking position data were registered to preoperative 3D images using a vessel-based registration algorithm. A total of 72 cannulations were attempted with both methods, and 79% (57) were successful on the first attempt for both techniques. There was no difference in cannulation rate (p=1), and time-use was similar. Successful cannulation with image fusion was achieved in 97% of cases when multiple attempts were allowed. This study demonstrated the feasibility of a steerable and EM trackable catheter with 3D image navigation. Navigation performance with EM tracking was similar to image fusion, without statistically significant differences in cannulation rates and procedure times. Further studies are needed to demonstrate this utility in patients with aortic disease. Electromagnetic tracking in combination with a novel steerable catheter reduces radiation and contrast media doses while providing three-dimensional visualization and agile navigation during endovascular aortic procedures.",

        "Abstract": "Autoimmune diseases (AID) are increasingly prevalent conditions which comprise more than 100 distinct clinical entities that are responsible for a great disease burden worldwide. The early recognition of these diseases is key for preventing their complications and for tailoring proper management. In most cases, autoantibodies, regardless of their potential pathogenetic role, can be detected in the serum of patients with AID, helping clinicians in making a definitive diagnosis and allowing screening strategies for early -and sometimes pre-clinical- diagnosis. Despite their undoubted crucial role, in a minority of cases, patients with AID may not show any autoantibody, a condition that is referred to as seronegative AID. Suboptimal accuracy of the available laboratory tests, antibody absorption, immunosuppressive therapy, immunodeficiencies, antigen exhaustion, and immunosenescence are the main possible determinants of seronegative AID. Indeed, in seronegative AID, the diagnosis is more challenging and must rely on clinical features and on other available tests, often including histopathological evaluation and radiological diagnostic tests. In this review, we critically dissect, in a narrative fashion, the possible causes of seronegativity, as well as the diagnostic and management implications, in several AID including autoimmune gastritis, celiac disease, autoimmune liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune encephalitis, myasthenia gravis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, and autoimmune thyroid diseases.",

Advances in the understanding of the immunopathogenesis and response to immunotherapy of seropositive autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes and the autoimmune-like celiac disease have revealed novel therapeutic opportunities. An improved understanding of preclinical disease states and how disease risk can be mitigated underpins further development of therapeutics to restore tolerance for disease prevention or early disease interception.",

        "Abstract": "Bile acids are amphipathic, detergent molecules. The detergent effects of di-\u03b1-hydroxy-bile acids are relevant to several colonic diseases. The aims were to review the concentrations of bile acids reaching the human colon in health and disease, the molecular structure of bile acids that determine detergent functions and the relationship to human diseases (neuroendocrine tumors, microscopic colitis, active celiac disease, and ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and ileal resection), the relationship to bacterial uptake into the mucosa, mucin depletion, and epithelial damage, the role of bile acids in mucosal inflammation and microscopic colitis, and the role of sulfation of bile salts in detoxification or prevention of the detergent effects of bile acids. The concentrations of bile acids reaching the human colon range from 2 to 10 mM; di-\u03b1-hydroxy bile acids are the only bile acids with detergent effects that include mucin depletion, mucosal damage, bacterial uptake, and microscopic inflammation that may be manifest in diseases associated with no overt inflammation of the mucosa, such as bile acid diarrhea, ileal diseases such as neuroendocrine tumors, ileal resection, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Sulfation inactivates colonic secretion due to primary bile acids, but it may render secondary bile acids proinflammatory in the colon. Other evidence in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggests reduced sulfation causes barrier dysfunction, inflammation, or carcinogenesis. These advances emphasize relevance and opportunities afforded by greater understanding of the chemistry and metabolism of bile acids, which stands to be further enhanced by research into the metabolic interactions of microbiota with bile acids.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to show the relationship between gluten-free diet (GFD) compliance in Celiac Disease (CD) and early atherosclerotic findings in pediatric patients and to test the effectiveness of carotid-intima-media-thickness (cIMT) to possibly predict long-term compliance to the GFD. Patients from 6 to 18\u2009years of age with a diagnosis of CD confirmed by endoscopic duodenal biopsy who were followed at our hospital's pediatric gastroenterology outpatient clinic between November 2020 and May 2021 were evaluated in this single-center, prospective study. The study patients were divided into two groups according to GFD compliance. Serologic and biochemical tests were conducted routinely during the follow-up period. cIMT was measured using ultrasound for both groups. A total of 80 patients (GFD-non-compliant: n\u2009=\u200935, GFD-compliant: n\u2009=\u200945) were evaluated. No significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of demographic data and pathology results. The mean cIMT value was 0.44\u2009\u00b1\u20090.028\u2009mm for the GFD-compliant group and 0.54\u2009\u00b1\u20090.036\u2009mm for the GFD-non-compliant group, with a statistically significant between-group difference (P\u2009<\u2009.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.992 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.978-1, P\u2009<\u2009.001) for discrimination of the groups. In addition, a cutoff value of 0.486\u2009mm for cIMT showed 96% (95% CI: 0.83-0.99) sensitivity and 94% (95% CI: 0.79-0.99) specificity for distinguishing GFD-compliant patients from non-GFD-compliant patients. In this study, the relationship between long-term GFD compliance and cIMT was demonstrated in CD. Currently used by some authors for the assessment of preclinical atherosclerosis, cIMT can also be used as a long-term indicator of dietary compliance as well as cardiovascular risk.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is now viewed as a systemic disease with multifaceted clinical manifestations. Among the extra-intestinal features, neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are still a diagnostic challenge, since they can precede or follow the diagnosis of CD. In particular, it is well known that some adults with CD may complain of cognitive symptoms, that improve when the gluten-free diet (GFD) is started, although they may re-appear after incidental gluten intake. Among the neurophysiological techniques, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can non-invasively probe in vivo the excitation state of cortical areas and cortico-spinal conductivity, being also able to unveil preclinical impairment in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, as well as in some systemic diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS), such as CD. We previously demonstrated an intracortical disinhibition and hyperfacilitation of MEP responses to TMS in newly diagnosed patients. However, no data are available on the central cholinergic functioning indexed by specific TMS measures, such as the short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), which might represent the neurophysiological correlate of cognitive changes in CD patients, also at the preclinical level. Cognitive and depressive symptoms were screened by means of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), respectively, in 15 consecutive de novo CD patients and 15 healthy controls. All patients were on normal diet at the time of the enrolment. Brain computed tomography (CT) was performed in all patients. SAI, recorded at two interstimulus intervals (2 and 8 ms), was assessed as the percentage amplitude ratio between the conditioned and the unconditioned MEP response. Resting motor threshold, MEP amplitude and latency, and central motor conduction time were also measured. The two groups were comparable for age, sex, anthropometric features, and educational level. Brain CT ruled out intracranial calcifications and clear radiological abnormalities in all patients. Scores at MoCA and HDRS were significantly worse in patients than in controls. The comparison of TMS data between the two groups revealed no statistically significant difference for all measures, including SAI at both interstimulus intervals. Central cholinergic functioning explored by the SAI of the motor cortex resulted to be not affected in these de novo CD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls. Although the statistically significant difference in MoCA, an overt cognitive impairment was not clinically evident in CD patients. Coherently, to date, no study based on TMS or other diagnostic techniques has shown any involvement of the central acetylcholine or the cholinergic fibers within the CNS in CD. This finding might add support to the vascular inflammation hypothesis underlying the so-called \"gluten encephalopathy\", which seems to be due to an aetiology different from that of the cholinergic dysfunction. Longitudinal studies correlating clinical, TMS, and neuroimaging data, both before and after GFD, are needed.",

        "Abstract": "Recent patient studies have shown that gluten-free diet is less effective in treating celiac disease than previously believed, and additionally patients remain vulnerable to gluten-induced acute symptoms and systemic cytokine release. Safe and effective pharmacological adjuncts to gluten-free diet are in preclinical and clinical development. Clear understanding of the pathogenesis of celiac disease is critical for drug target identification, establishing efficacy endpoints and to develop noninvasive biomarkers suitable to monitor and potentially diagnose celiac disease. The role and clinical effects of CD4+\u00a0T cells directed against deamidated gluten in the context of an 'adaptive immune paradigm' are reviewed. Alternative hypotheses of gluten toxicity are discussed and contrasted. In the context of recent patient studies, implications of the adaptive immune paradigm for future strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat celiac disease are outlined. Effective therapeutics for celiac disease are likely to be approved and necessitate a variety of new clinical instruments and tests to stratify patient need, monitor remission, and confirm diagnosis in uncertain cases. Sensitive assessments of CD4+\u00a0T cells specific for deamidated gluten are likely to play a central role in clinical management, and to facilitate research and pharmaceutical development.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac Disease (CeD) is estimated to currently affect 2 million Americans in the United States. This autoimmune disorder occurs when the consumption of gluten-based products leads to an inflammatory response in the small intestine. Over time, this inflammatory response permanently damages the villi in the small intestine. Celiac disease patients generally present with fatigue, diarrhea, and weight loss due to the disease. The current gold standard for diagnosing CeD is the endoscopy with duodenal biopsy indicating villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. No FDA-approved medication exists for the treatment of CeD and the only recommended course to alleviate CeD induced symptoms is to abstain from consuming any gluten-based products. There are several clinical trials actively developing and testing pharmacological approaches to treat CeD. Two of the further advanced clinical trials include AT-1001 (Larazotide acetate) and IMGX-003 (Latiglutenase; formerly known as ALV003) therapies. These drugs aim to alleviate celiac disease-induced symptoms using two different approaches. AT-1001 aims to close the villi's tight junctions, while IMGX-003 acts as a gluten endopeptidase that degrades gluten before being absorbed in the small intestine. This review article summarizes the various preclinical research and clinical trials being conducted and specifies the mechanism by which these drugs function.",

        "Abstract": "The incidence and prevalence rate of chronic inflammatory disorders is on the rise in the pediatric population. Recent research indicates the crucial role of interactions between the altered intestinal microbiome and the immune system in the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory disorders in children, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and celiac disease (CeD). Here, we review recent knowledge concerning the pathogenic mechanisms underlying these disorders, and summarize the facts suggesting that the initiation and progression of IBD, T1DM, and CeD can be partially attributed to disturbances in the patterns of composition and abundance of the gut microbiota. The standard available therapies for chronic inflammatory disorders in children largely aim to treat symptoms. Although constant efforts are being made to maximize the quality of life for children in the long-term, sustained improvements are still difficult to achieve. Additional challenges are the changing physiology associated with growth and development of children, a population that is particularly susceptible to medication-related adverse effects. In this review, we explore new promising therapeutic approaches aimed at modulation of either gut microbiota or the activity of the immune system to induce a long-lasting remission of chronic inflammatory disorders. Recent preclinical studies and clinical trials have evaluated new approaches, for instance the adoptive transfer of immune cells, with genetically engineered regulatory T cells expressing antigen-specific chimeric antigen receptors. These approaches have revolutionized cancer treatments and have the potential for the protection of high-risk children from developing autoimmune diseases and effective management of inflammatory disorders. The review also focuses on the findings of studies that indicate that the responses to a variety of immunotherapies can be enhanced by strategic manipulation of gut microbiota, thus emphasizing on the importance of proper interaction between the gut microbiota and immune system for sustained health benefits and improvement of the quality of life of pediatric patients.",

Together, their prevalence is estimated to be ~5% in the general population, however, in the last years the number of diagnoses has been rapidly increasing. To this day, the gold standard treatment for these disorders is the complete removal of gluten-containing grains from the diet. Although this therapy results effective in the majority of patients, up to 30% of individuals affected by GRD continue to present persistent symptoms. In addition, gluten-free diet has been shown to have poor nutritional quality and to cause a socio-economic burden in patients' quality of life. In order to respond to these issues, the scientific community has been focusing on finding additional and adjuvant non-dietary therapies. In this review, we focus on two main gluten related disorders, celiac disease and non-celiac wheat sensitivity.

        "Abstract": "Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a member of the IL-2 family of cytokines, which use receptor complexes containing the common gamma (\u03b3<sub>c</sub>) chain for signaling. IL-15 plays important roles in innate and adaptative immune responses and is implicated in the pathogenesis of several immune diseases. The IL-15 receptor consists of 3 subunits namely, the ligand-binding IL-15R\u03b1 chain, the \u03b2 chain (also used by IL-2) and the \u03b3<sub>c</sub> chain. IL-15 uses a unique signaling pathway whereby IL-15 associates with IL-15R\u03b1 during biosynthesis, and this complex is 'trans-presented' to responder cells that expresses the IL-2/15R\u03b2\u03b3<sub>c</sub> receptor complex. IL-15 is subject to post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation, and evidence also suggests that IL-15 cis-signaling can occur under certain conditions. IL-15 has been implicated in the pathology of various autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease and psoriasis. Studies with pre-clinical models have shown the beneficial effects of targeting IL-15 signaling in autoimmunity. Unlike therapies targeting other cytokines, anti-IL-15 therapies have not yet been successful in humans. We discuss the complexities of IL-15 signaling in autoimmunity and explore potential immunotherapeutic approaches to target the IL-15 signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "Although celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease that primarily involves the intestinal tract, mounting evidence suggests that a sizeable number of patients exhibit neurological deficits. About 40% of the celiac patients with neurological manifestations have circulating antibodies against neural tissue transglutaminase-6 (tTG6). While early diagnosis and strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) have been recommended to prevent neurological dysfunction, better therapeutic strategies are needed to improve the overall quality of life. Dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, presence of anti-tTG6 antibodies, and epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis. It is also possible that circulating or gut-derived extracellular structures and including biomolecular condensates and extracellular vesicles contribute to disease pathogenesis. There are several avenues for shaping the dysregulated gut homeostasis in individuals with CD, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and/or neurodegeneration. In addition to GFD and probiotics, nutraceuticals, such as phyto and synthetic cannabinoids, represent a new approach that could shape the host microbiome towards better prognostic outcomes. Finally, we provide a data-driven rationale for potential future pre-clinical research involving non-human primates (NHPs) to investigate the effect of nutraceuticals, such as phyto and synthetic cannabinoids, either alone or in combination with GFD to prevent/mitigate dietary gluten-induced neurodegeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease affects approximately 1% of the population and is a major public health problem worldwide. It is trigged by gluten-derived peptides, which have unusually high proline-glutamine motif content and are highly resistant to proteolysis by digestive enzymes of the gastrointestinal tract. The only treatment for celiac disease is strict, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet, which is effective but costly and difficult to maintain. Therefore, novel non-dietary therapies for celiac disease are urgently needed. Gluten-degrading enzymes are promising non-dietary treatments, and some enzymes have been investigated in preclinical or clinical studies. A combination of prolyl endopeptidase from Sphingomonas capsulata (SC PEP) and a glutamine-specific endoprotease (EP-B2 from barley) known as latiglutenase showed insufficient benefits in phase II clinical trials, likely because of its low enzyme activity in the gastric environment. Therefore, improving enzyme activity is essential for the clinical application of SC PEP. Enzyme activity can be enhanced using computer-aided rational protein design tools. In this study, we combined molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation to rationally design SC PEP mutants and experimentally evaluated their activities. We identified mutants with up to 90-103% increases in specific activity and up to 80-202% increases in the catalytic rate. We have investigated the mechanism underlying the enhanced activity of these mutants, and found that a conformational transition of the \u03b2-propeller domain and catalytic domain of SC PEP was important for enzyme activity, and this transition was affected by residues in the catalytic domain and at the domain interface; a shorter distance between the substrate Pro and the oxyanion holes was also crucial for improving SC PEP catalytic activity. Our results provide useful information for the rational design of highly active SC PEPs to accelerate the development of enzyme therapeutics candidates for Celiac disease.",

        "Abstract": "Improved hygiene leading to reduced exposure to microorganisms has been implicated as one possible cause for the recent \"epidemic\" of chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs) in industrialized countries. That is the essence of the hygiene hypothesis that argues that rising incidence of CIDs may be, at least in part, the result of lifestyle and environmental changes that have made us too \"clean\" for our own good, so causing changes in our microbiota. Apart from genetic makeup and exposure to environmental triggers, inappropriate increase in intestinal permeability (which may be influenced by the composition of the gut microbiota), a \"hyper-belligerent\" immune system responsible for the tolerance-immune response balance, and the composition of gut microbiome and its epigenetic influence on the host genomic expression have been identified as three additional elements in causing CIDs. During the past decade, a growing number of publications have focused on human genetics, the gut microbiome, and proteomics, suggesting that loss of mucosal barrier function, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, may substantially affect antigen trafficking, ultimately influencing the close bidirectional interaction between gut microbiome and our immune system. This cross-talk is highly influential in shaping the host gut immune system function and ultimately shifting genetic predisposition to clinical outcome. This observation led to a re-visitation of the possible causes of CIDs epidemics, suggesting a key pathogenic role of gut permeability. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that the zonulin family, a group of proteins modulating gut permeability, is implicated in a variety of CIDs, including autoimmune, infective, metabolic, and tumoral diseases. These data offer novel therapeutic targets for a variety of CIDs in which the zonulin pathway is implicated in their pathogenesis.",

Furthermore, although studies in humans have led to major advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of coeliac disease<sup>4</sup>, the respective roles of disease-predisposing HLA molecules, and of adaptive and innate immunity in the development of tissue damage, have not been directly demonstrated. Here we describe a mouse model that reproduces the overexpression of\u00a0interleukin-15 (IL-15) in the gut epithelium and lamina propria that is characteristic of active coeliac disease, expresses the predisposing HLA-DQ8 molecule, and develops villous atrophy after ingestion of gluten. Overexpression of IL-15 in both the epithelium and the lamina propria is required for the development of villous atrophy, which demonstrates the location-dependent central role of IL-15 in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease. In addition, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and HLA-DQ8 have a crucial role in the licensing of cytotoxic T cells to mediate intestinal epithelial cell lysis. We also demonstrate a role for the cytokine interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) and the\u00a0enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in tissue destruction. By reflecting the complex interaction between gluten, genetics and IL-15-driven tissue inflammation, this mouse model provides the opportunity to both increase our understanding of coeliac disease, and develop new therapeutic strategies.",

        "Abstract": "Coeliac disease is a chronic and systemic autoimmune condition triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed subjects. Currently, the only effective treatment available is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet. However, patients perceive gluten withdrawal as an unsustainable burden in their life and some of them can exhibit persistent symptoms despite a strict diet. Thus, gluten-free diet represents a challenge, leading scientists to look for alternative or complementary treatments. This review will focus on non-dietary therapies for coeliac disease highlighting six therapeutic strategies: (1) decreasing gluten immunogenic content before it reaches the intestine; (2) sequestering gluten in the gut lumen before absorption; (3) blocking the passage of gluten through a leaky intestinal barrier; (4) preventing the enhancement of immune response against gliadin; (5) dampening the downstream immune activation; (6) inducing immune tolerance to gluten. Most developing therapies are only in the pre-clinical phase with only a few being tested in phase 2b or 3 trials. Although new approaches raise the hope for coeliacs giving them a chance to come back to gluten, for the time being a cautionary appraisal of new therapies suggests that they may have a complementary role to gluten withdrawal, mainly to prevent inadvertent gluten contamination.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease can develop at any age, but outcomes of adults with positive results from serologic tests for tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) without endoscopic determination of celiac disease (called celiac autoimmunity) have not been thoroughly evaluated. We investigated the proportion of adults with celiac autoimmunity at a community medical center and their progression to celiac disease. We analyzed waste blood samples from a community clinic from 15,551 adults for tTGA and, if titer results were above 2 U/mL, for endomysial antibody. The blood samples had been collected at 2 time points (median interval, 8.8 years) from 2006 through 2017. We collected data from the clinic on diagnoses of celiac disease based on duodenal biopsy analysis. Of the serum samples collected at the first time point, 15,398 had negative results for tTGA, and 153 had positive results for tTGA (>4 U/mL). Based on medical records, 6 individuals received a diagnosis of celiac disease, for a cumulative incidence of celiac disease diagnosis of 0.06% (95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.11). Forty-nine (0.32%) individuals with a negative result from the first serologic test for tTGA had a positive result from the second test. Among the 153 adults who were tTGA positive at the first time point, 31 (20%) had a subsequent diagnosis of celiac disease, 81 (53%) remained positive for tTGA without a clinical diagnosis of celiac disease, and 41 (27%) had negative test results for tTGA at the second time point. Higher initial tTGA titers, female sex, and a history of hypothyroidism and autoimmune disease were associated with increased risks of subsequent diagnosis of celiac disease. Interestingly, adults whose first blood sample had a positive test result but second blood sample had a negative result for tTGA were older, had lower-than-average initial tTGA titer results, and had a higher mean body mass index than adults whose blood samples were positive for tTGA at both time points and adults later diagnosed with celiac disease. In an analysis of serum samples collected from a community clinic an average of 8.8 years apart, we found that fewer than 1% of adults with negative results from an initial test for tTGA have a positive result on a second test. Of adults with positive results from the test for tTGA, only 20% are later diagnosed with celiac disease; the remaining individuals maintain persistent increases in tTGA without diagnoses of celiac disease or have negative results from second tests.",

        "Abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are valuable as research reagents, in diagnosis and in therapy. Their high specificity, the ease in production, favorable biophysical properties and the opportunity to engineer different properties make mAbs a versatile class of biologics. mAbs targeting peptide-major histocompatibility molecule (pMHC) complexes are often referred to as \"TCR-like\" mAbs, as pMHC complexes are generally recognized by T-cell receptors (TCRs). Presentation of self- and non-self-derived peptide fragments on MHC molecules and subsequent activation of T cells dictate immune responses in health and disease. This includes responses to infectious agents or cancer but also aberrant responses against harmless self-peptides in autoimmune diseases. The ability of TCR-like mAbs to target specific peptides presented on MHC allows for their use to study peptide presentation or for diagnosis and therapy. This extends the scope of conventional mAbs, which are generally limited to cell-surface or soluble antigens. Herein, we review the strategies used to generate TCR-like mAbs and provide a structural comparison with the analogous TCR in pMHC binding. We further discuss their applications as research tools and therapeutic reagents in preclinical models as well as challenges and limitations associated with their use.",

Antigen-specific tolerization of the immune system in protein replacement therapy for hemophilia A is an accepted treatment. Clinical trials are ongoing for autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and rheumatoid arthritis with various antigen-specific strategies. Trials for tolerization in celiac disease aim for antigen specific tolerance to gluten, an environmental trigger, which may then halt the progression to autoimmunity targeting a self-antigen, tissue transglutaminase. Although many promising approaches have been demonstrated in pre-clinical models, this review will focus primarily on clinical trials of antigen-specific tolerance that have been taken to the clinic and with initial results reported in the peer reviewed literature.

        "Title": "Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and autophagy: hereditary defects in cystic fibrosis <i>versus</i> gluten-mediated inhibition in celiac disease.",
        "Abstract": "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most frequent lethal monogenetic disease affecting humans. CF is characterized by mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel whose malfunction triggers the activation of transglutaminase-2 (TGM2), as well as the inactivation of the Beclin-1 (BECN1) complex resulting in disabled autophagy. CFTR inhibition, TGM2 activation and BECN1 sequestration engage in an 'infernal trio' that locks the cell in a pro-inflammatory state through anti-homeostatic feedforward loops. Thus, stimulation of CFTR function, TGM2 inhibition and autophagy stimulation can be used to treat CF patients. Several studies indicate that patients with CF have a higher incidence of celiac disease (CD) and that mice bearing genetically determined CFTR defects are particularly sensitive to the enteropathogenic effects of the orally supplied gliadin (a gluten-derived protein). A gluten/gliadin-derived peptide (P31-43) inhibits CFTR in mouse intestinal epithelial cells, causing a local stress response that contributes to the immunopathology of CD. In particular, P31-43-induced CFTR inhibition elicits an epithelial stress response perturbing proteostasis. This event triggers TGM2 activation, BECN1 sequestration and results in molecular crosslinking of CFTR and P31-43 by TGM2. Importantly, stimulation of CFTR function with a pharmacological potentiator (Ivacaftor), which is approved for the treatment of CF, could attenuate the autophagy-inhibition and pro-inflammatory effects of gliadin in preclinical models of CD. Thus, CD shares with CF a common molecular mechanism involving CFTR inhibition that might respond to drugs that intercept the \"infernal trio\". Here, we highlight how drugs available for CF treatment could be repurposed for the therapy of CD.",

        "Title": "Evolving Therapy for Celiac Disease.",
        "Abstract": "Gluten is known to be the main triggering factor for celiac disease (CeD), an immune-mediated disorder. CeD is therefore managed using a strict and lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD), the only effective treatment available currently. However, the GFD is restrictive. Hence, efforts are being made to explore alternative therapies. Based on their mechanisms of action on various molecular targets involved in the pathogenesis of CeD, these therapies may be classified into one of the following five broad approaches. The first approach focuses on decreasing the immunogenic content of gluten, using strategies like genetically modified wheat, intra-intestinal gluten digestion using glutenases, microwave thermal treatment of hydrated wheat kernels, and gluten pretreatment with either bacterial/ fungal derived endopeptidases or microbial transglutaminase. The second approach involves sequestering gluten in the gut lumen before it is digested into immunogenic peptides and absorbed, using binder drugs like polymer p(HEMA-co-SS), single chain fragment variable (scFv), and anti- gluten antibody AGY. The third approach aims to prevent uptake of digested gluten through intestinal epithelial tight junctions, using a zonulin antagonist. The fourth approach involves tissue transglutaminase (tTG) inhibitors to prevent the enhancement of immunogenicity of digested gluten by the intestinal tTG enzyme. The fifth approach seeks to prevent downstream immune activation after uptake of gluten immunogenic peptides through the intestinal mucosal epithelial layer. Examples include HLA-DQ2 blockers that prevent presentation of gluten derived- antigens by dendritic cells to T cells, immune- tolerizing therapies like the vaccine Nexvax2 and TIMP-Glia, cathepsin inhibitors, immunosuppressants like corticosteroids, azathioprine etc., and anti-cytokine agents targeting TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin-15. Apart from these approaches, research is being done to evaluate the effectiveness of probiotics/prebiotics, helminth therapy using <i>Necator americanus</i>, low FODMAP diet, and pancreatic enzyme supplementation in CeD symptom control; however, the mechanisms by which they play a beneficial role in CeD are yet to be clearly established. Overall, although many therapies being explored are still in the pre-clinical phase, some like the zonulin antagonist, immune tolerizing therapies and glutenases have reached phase II/III clinical trials. While these potential options appear exciting, currently they may at best be used to supplement rather than supplant the GFD.",

        "Title": "Breaking Down Barriers: How Understanding Celiac Disease Pathogenesis Informed the Development of Novel Treatments.",
        "Abstract": "For decades, the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases has been attributed to increased intestinal paracellular permeability even though scientific evidence supporting this hypothesis has been tenuous. Nevertheless, during the past decade, there have been a growing number of publications focused on human genetics, the gut microbiome, and proteomics, suggesting that loss of mucosal barrier function, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, may substantially affect antigen trafficking, ultimately causing chronic inflammation, including autoimmunity, in genetically predisposed individuals. The gut mucosa works as a semipermeable barrier in that it permits nutrient absorption and also regulates immune surveillance while retaining potentially harmful microbes and environmental antigens within the intestinal lumen. Celiac disease (CD), a systemic, immune-mediated disorder triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, is associated with altered gut permeability. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that gliadin, a prolamine component of gluten that is implicated in CD pathogenesis, is capable to disassembling intercellular junctional proteins by upregulating the zonulin pathway, which can be inhibited by the zonulin antagonist larazotide acetate. In this review, we will focus on CD as a paradigm of chronic inflammatory diseases in order to outline the contribution of gut paracellular permeability toward disease pathogenesis; moreover, we will summarize current evidence derived from available clinical trials of larazotide acetate in CD.",

Animal models serve as critical tools to advance the understanding of the mechanisms of wheat allergenicity to develop preventive and control methods. A comprehensive review on the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity using animal models is unavailable at present. There were two major objectives of this study: To identify the lessons that animal models have taught us regarding the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity and to identify the strengths, challenges, and future prospects of animal models in basic and applied wheat allergy research. Using the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, we retrieved and critically analyzed the relevant articles and excluded celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Our analysis shows that animal models can provide insight into the IgE epitope structure of wheat allergens, effects of detergents and other chemicals on wheat allergenicity, and the role of genetics, microbiome, and food processing in wheat allergy. Although animal models have inherent limitations, they are critical to advance knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity. They can also serve as highly useful pre-clinical testing tools to develop safer genetically modified wheat, hypoallergenic wheat products, novel pharmaceuticals, and vaccines.",

NKRs expression was compared by flow cytometry in intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) from CD, type I or type II refractory CD (RCD). NKp46 was next assessed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded biopsies from 204 patients with CD, RCDI, RCDII or GI T-cell lymphomas and from a validation cohort of 61 patients. The cytotoxic properties of an anti-NKp46 monoclonal antibody conjugated to pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) was tested <i>ex vivo</i> in human primary tumour cells isolated from fresh duodenal biopsies. NKp46 (but not CD94, NKG2A, NKG2C, NKG2D) was significantly more expressed by malignant RCDII IEL than by normal IEL in CD and RCDI. In paraffin biopsies, detection of >25 NKp46+ IEL\u2009per 100 epithelial cells discriminated RCDII from CD and RCDI. NKp46 was also detected in enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphomas (EATL, 24/29) and in monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphomas (MEITL, 4/4) but not in indolent T-LPD (0/15). Treatment with anti-NKp46-PBD could efficiently and selectively kill human NKp46+ primary\u2009IEL <i>ex vivo</i>.

        "Abstract": "Angiotensin II-infused ApoE-/- mice are a popular mouse model for preclinical aneurysm research. Here, we provide insight in the often-reported but seldom-explained variability in shape of dissecting aneurysms in these mice. N\u2009=\u200945 excised aortas were scanned ex vivo with phase-contrast X-ray tomographic microscopy. Micro-ruptures were detected near the ostium of celiac and mesenteric arteries in 8/11 mice that were sacrificed after 3 days of angiotensin II-infusion. At later time points (after 10, 18, and 28 days) the variability in shape of thoraco-abdominal lesions (occurring in 31/34 mice) was classified into 7 different categories based on the presence or absence of a medial tear (31/31), an intramural hematoma (23/31) or a false channel (11/23). Medial tears were detected both in the thoracic and the abdominal aorta and were most prevalent at the left and ventral aspects of celiac and mesenteric arteries. The axial length of the hematoma strongly correlated to the total number of ruptured branch ostia (r2 = 0.78) and in 22/23 mice with a hematoma the ostium of the left suprarenal artery had ruptured. Supraceliac diameters at baseline were significantly lower for mice that did not develop an intramural hematoma, and the formation of a false channel within that intramural hematoma depended on the location, rather than the length, of the medial tear. Based on our observations we propose an elaborate hypothesis that explains how aortic side branches (i) affect the initiation and propagation of medial tears and the subsequent adventitial dissection and (ii) affect the variability in shape of dissecting aneurysms. This hypothesis was partially validated through the live visualization of a dissecting aneurysm that formed during micro-CT imaging, and led us to the conclusion that angiotensin II-infused mice are more clinically relevant for the study of aortic dissections than for the study of abdominal aortic aneurysms.",

        "Abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) display unique aggressive behavior, invading the articular cartilage and promoting inflammation. Using an integrative analysis of RA risk alleles, the transcriptome and methylome in RA FLS, we recently identified the limb bud and heart development (<i>LBH</i>) gene as a key dysregulated gene in RA and other autoimmune diseases. Although some evidence suggests that LBH could modulate the cell cycle, the precise mechanism is unknown and its impact on inflammation in vivo has not been defined. Our cell cycle analysis studies show that LBH deficiency in FLS leads to S-phase arrest and failure to progress through the cell cycle. LBH-deficient FLS had increased DNA damage and reduced expression of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase \u03b1. Decreased DNA polymerase \u03b1 was followed by checkpoint arrest due to phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 1. Because DNA fragments can increase arthritis severity in preclinical models, we then explored the effect of LBH deficiency in the K/BxN serum transfer model. <i>Lbh</i> knockout exacerbated disease severity, which is associated with elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2 and checkpoint kinase 1 phosphorylation. These studies indicate that LBH deficiency induces S-phase arrest that, in turn, exacerbates inflammation. Because <i>LBH</i> gene variants are associated with type I diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, RA, and celiac disease, these results suggest a general mechanism that could contribute to immune-mediated diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Coeliac disease, a prevalent immune-mediated enteropathy driven by dietary gluten, provides an exceptional human model to dissect the genetic, environmental and immunologic factors operating in autoimmunity. Despite the causative antigen being an exogenous food protein, coeliac disease has many features in common with autoimmune disease including a strong HLA class II association and the presence of pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and autoantibodies. CD8<sup>+</sup> intraepithelial lymphocytes specifically target and destroy intestinal epithelium in response to stress signals and not a specific antigen. A unique feature of coeliac disease is the ability to remove gluten to induce disease remission and reintroduce it to trigger a memory response. This provides an unparalleled opportunity to study disease-relevant CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that have been expanded <i>in vivo.</i> As a result, the causative peptides have been characterised at a level unprecedented for any autoimmune disease. Despite the complexity of the gluten proteome, resistance to gastrointestinal proteolysis and susceptibility to post-translational modification by transglutaminase help shape a restricted repertoire of immunogenic gluten peptides that have high affinity for disease-associated HLA. The critical steps in coeliac disease pathogenesis have been broadly elucidated and provide the basis for experimental therapies in pre-clinical or clinical development. However, little is known about how and why tolerance to gluten sometimes breaks or fails to develop.

        "Abstract": "Coeliac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by gluten and characterized by a strong T helper type 1 (Th1)/Th17 immune response in the small intestine. Regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub> ) are CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>++</sup> forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3<sup>+</sup> ) cells that regulate the immune response. Conversely to its counterpart, FoxP3 full length (FL), the alternatively spliced isoform FoxP3 \u03942, cannot properly down-regulate the Th17-driven immune response. As the active state of CD has been associated with impairments in T<sub>reg</sub> cell function, we aimed at determining whether imbalances between FoxP3 isoforms may be associated with the disease. Intestinal biopsies from patients with active CD showed increased expression of FOXP3 \u03942 isoform over FL, while both isoforms were expressed similarly in non-coeliac control subjects (HC). Conversely to what we saw in the intestine, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HC subjects did not show the same balance between isoforms. We therefore hypothesized that the intestinal microenvironment may play a role in modulating alternative splicing. The proinflammatory intestinal microenvironment of active patients has been reported to be enriched in butyrate-producing bacteria, while high concentrations of lactate have been shown to characterize the preclinical stage of the disease. We show that the combination of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and butyrate triggers the balance between FoxP3 isoforms in HC subjects, while the same does not occur in CD patients. Furthermore, we report that lactate increases both isoforms in CD patients. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of the ratio between FoxP3 isoforms in CD and, for the first time, associate the alternative splicing process mechanistically with microbial-derived metabolites.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the perceived importance, knowledge and confidence in nutritional management in a sample of Australian medical students undertaking a 4-year postgraduate medical degree. In 2015, students in years 1-4 were anonymously surveyed to assess students' perceived importance of nutrition, and knowledge and confidence in nutritional management. A total of 131 first and second year (preclinical/yr 1-2) medical students (46% response rate) and 66 third and fourth year (clinical/yr 3-4) students (24% response rate) completed the questionnaire. Most preclinical students agreed that medical graduates should understand nutritional issues in managing cardiovascular disease (99%), type 2 diabetes (93%), coeliac disease (95%), and renal impairment (97%). However, students were limited in their confidence to demonstrate this knowledge (range of confidence: 26%-41%) for individual medical conditions. This improved for students in the clinical context of years 3 and 4, although it was still not optimal (range 26%-81%). Few year 3 and 4 students reported confidence in knowledge related to medicolegal issues, respiratory disease, nutritional guidelines and nutrition assessment (all <40%). However the majority (>80%) reported confidence in the dietary management of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and coeliac disease and >60% indicated they would refer onto nutrition professionals. This cohort of postgraduate medical students recognize the importance of nutrition in disease. The number of students reporting increased confidence in nutritional management of a few select diseases where dietary management is one of the cornerstones of treatment (e.g. type 2 diabetes) rises throughout the course. However, students reported lower levels of knowledge in diseases where diet is secondary to other treatments and preventative strategies (e.g. respiratory disease). Filling the gap by integrating the nutritional management into the range of common chronic diseases during training has the potential to positively impact on patient health outcomes.",

        "Title": "Enhanced sympathetic nerve activity induced by neonatal colon inflammation induces gastric hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behavior in adult rats.",
        "Abstract": "Gastric hypersensitivity (GHS) and anxiety are prevalent in functional dyspepsia patients; their underlying mechanisms remain unknown largely because of lack of availability of live visceral tissues from human subjects. Recently, we demonstrated in a preclinical model that rats subjected to neonatal colon inflammation show increased basal plasma norepinephrine (NE), which contributes to GHS through the upregulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) expression in the gastric fundus. We tested the hypothesis that neonatal colon inflammation increases anxiety-like behavior and sympathetic nervous system activity, which upregulates the expression of NGF to induce GHS in adult life. Chemical sympathectomy, but not adrenalectomy, suppressed the elevated NGF expression in the fundus muscularis externa and GHS. The measurement of heart rate variability showed a significant increase in the low frequency-to-high frequency ratio in GHS vs. the control rats. Stimulus-evoked release of NE from the fundus muscularis externa strips was significantly greater in GHS than in the control rats. Tyrosine hydroxylase expression was increased in the celiac ganglia of the GHS vs. the control rats. We found an increase in trait but not stress-induced anxiety-like behavior in GHS rats in an elevated plus maze. We concluded that neonatal programming triggered by colon inflammation upregulates tyrosine hydroxylase in the celiac ganglia, which upregulates the release of NE in the gastric fundus muscularis externa. The increase of NE release from the sympathetic nerve terminals concentration dependently upregulates NGF, which proportionately increases the visceromotor response to gastric distention. Neonatal programming concurrently increases anxiety-like behavior in GHS rats.",

        "Abstract": "Primary tumor excision is one of the most widely used therapies of cancer. However, the risk of metastases development still exists following tumor resection. The liver is a common site of metastatic disease for numerous cancers. Breast cancer is one of the most frequent sources of metastases to the liver. The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of the orally administered Salmonella Typhi vaccine strain CVD 915 on the development of liver metastases in a mouse model of breast cancer. To this end, one group of BALB/c mice was orogastrically immunized with CVD 915, while another received PBS as a control. After 24\u2009h, mice were injected with LM3 mammary adenocarcinoma cells into the spleen and subjected to splenectomy. This oral Salmonella-based vaccine produced an antitumor effect, leading to a decrease in the number and volume of liver metastases. Immunization with Salmonella induced an early cellular immune response in mice. This innate stimulation rendered a large production of IFN-\u03b3 by intrahepatic immune cells (IHIC) detected within 24\u2009h. An antitumor adaptive immunity was found in the liver and celiac and portal lymph nodes (LDLN) 21\u2009days after oral bacterial inoculation. The antitumor immune response inside the liver was associated with increased CD4(+) and dendritic cell populations as well as with an inflammatory infiltrate located around liver metastatic nodules. Enlarged levels of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and TNF) were also detected in IHIC. Furthermore, a tumor-specific production of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF as well as tumor-specific IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells (CD8(+)IFN-\u03b3(+)) were found in the celiac and portal lymph nodes of Salmonella-treated mice. This study provides first evidence for the involvement of LDLN in the development of an efficient cellular immune response against hepatic tumors, which resulted in the elimination of liver metastases after oral Salmonella-based vaccination.",

        "Abstract": "Atherosclerosis, which is the cause of diseases of the cardiovascular system, and frequent and serious complications of type 1 diabetes (T1DM), has an autoimmune origin. Some diseases of this type, as rheumatoid arthritis, but also Hashimoto thyroiditis or celiac disease are associated with a higher incidence of heart disease. So far no studies evaluated the preclinical phase of development of atherosclerosis (cIMT) in young patients with T1DM and the comorbid additional autoimmune diseases. was evaluation of cIMT (carotid intima media thickness) carotid arteries and the risk factors of atherosclerosis in young patients with type 1 diabetes according to the comorbid autoimmune diseases and a comparison group of patients with known vascular complications and a group of healthy people. The study involved a group of 90 adolescents and young adults with T1DM in middle age 17,1\u00b13years, with an average disease duration of 10,5\u00b13,3 years. Diabetes patients were divided into 4 groups - diabetes without complications - C, diabetes with celiac disease - CC, diabetes with Hashimoto's thyroiditis - CH, diabetes with vascular complications - CN. The control group (K) consisted of 22 healthy age-matched volunteers. In statistical analysis rated: average A1C of all the years of illness, BMI, blood pressure, lipid values, duration of illness, presence of diabetes complications, daily insulin dose and cIMT thickness of the common carotid artery. cIMT of T1DM patients was significantly higher: 0,470 mm than in healthy: 0,409 mm. In the group with vascular complications of diabetes was found the highest rate of cIMT: 0,501 mm in comparison to the group of diabetes without complications: 0,462 mm, diabetes with celiac disease: 0,462 mm, and diabetes with Hashimoto's thyroiditis: 0,453 mm. HbA1c was highest in the group CN: 9,84\u00b11,5%, compared to CH: 9,04\u00b1 1,2%, CC: 8,84\u00b11,8% and C without complications: 8,55\u00b11,2%. BMI was highest in the group CN: 23,3\u00b1 4,4kg/m2and CH: 22,6 \u00b1 2,4 kg/m2. It was the same with waist circumference: CN: 79,33\u00b1 9,39and CH: 79,2 \u00b1 9,56 cm. Patients with vascular complications were characterized by the higher value of blood pressure and lipids compared to patients with additional autoimmune disease. Coexistence of celiac disease was not associated with a greater value of cIMT and cardiovascular risk factors in young patients with type 1 diabetes. 1. Increased value of cIMT, and thus increased risk of early disease of the cardiovascular system depends primarily on metabolic compensation and classic risk factors for atherosclerosis. 2. The coexistence of additional autoimmune disease does not significantly affect the value of cIMT in the study population. 3. Young patients with diabetes type 1 and coexisting Hashimoto disease have greater BMI and waist circumference, what can lead to earlier macroangiopathy in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic, small intestinal, immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Currently, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only available treatment. However, GFD alone is not sufficient to relieve symptoms, control small intestinal inflammation and prevent long-term complications in many patients. The GFD has its challenges including issues related to adherence, lifestyle restrictions and cost. As a result, there is growing interest in and a need for non-dietary therapies to manage this condition. In recent years, different targets in the immune-mediated cascade of CD have been identified in clinical and pre-clinical trials for potential therapies. This review will discuss the latest non-dietary therapies in CD, including endopeptidases, modulators of enterocyte tight junctions and agents involved in gluten tolerization and immunomodulation. We will also discuss the potential implications of approved therapeutics on CD clinical practice.",

        "Abstract": "At present, strict and lifelong gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment for celiac disease. Even small amounts of gluten (50\u2009mg/day) can be immunogenic; therefore all food and food items and drugs that contain gluten and its derivatives must be eliminated completely from the diet. While prescribing gluten-free diet is easy; the key to the success is the dietary counseling by a nutrition specialist and maintenance of adherence to GFD by the patient. In recent times, a number of targets to halt the process of immunological injury have been explored to find out alternative treatment for celiac disease. These targets include exploration of ancient wheat if they are less immunogenic, intra-luminal digestion of gluten using prolylendopeptidases, pretreatment of whole gluten with bacterial-derived peptidase before ingestion; prevention of passage of immunogenic peptides through the tight junctions such as zonulin antagonists, Blocking of HLA-DQ2 to prevent binding of immunogenic peptides, inhibition of transglutaminase 2, immune-modulation, and induction of tolerance to gluten using gluten tolerizing vaccines, use of gluten-sequestering polymers, use of anti-inflammatory drugs (glucocorticoids, budesonides) and anti-cytokines such as anti TNF-\u03b1, and anti-interleukin-15. While many of these targets are still in the pre-clinical phase, some of them including zonulin antagonist and endopeptidases have already reached phase II and phase III clinical trials. Furthermore, while these targets appear very exciting; they at best are likely to be used as adjunctive therapy rather than a complete replacement for gluten-free diet.",

        "Abstract": "Gluten, the primary network builder of wheat dough, is responsible for celiac disease or wheat allergy. Transamidation of gluten under reduction conditions has been shown to reduce the potential toxicity of celiac disease, but its application in food preparation has not been extensively studied. This work investigates the use of transamidation in food preparation to address this gap in knowledge. This study investigates the effects of transamidation on the toxicity of commercial wheat flour and the apparent structure, digestive level, and rheological characteristics of resultant dough and steamed bread, as a typical food model. The results show that transamidation starts at the kneading stage, as evaluated by using R5 enzyme-linked immunoassay and rat basophils. The potential toxicity of celiac disease is reduced by about 83% when 1% microbial transglutaminase (mTG), 2% l-lysine, and 1% reduced glutathione (GSH) are added, while retaining the original physical and rheological properties of wheat flour. The additional of reduced GSH also improves the in vitro protein digestibility. Although it cannot be a celiac disease treatment directly, this study suggests that transamidation can serve as an alternative method for reducing the gluten toxicity of wheat flour-based food products.",

We performed the celiac ganglia neurolysis (CGN) or sham surgery on both spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and Dahl salt-sensitive rat models of hypertension. Following CGN surgery in both strains, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were all lower than the levels in the respective sham surgery rats, which were maintained until the end of the study, 18 weeks postoperatively in SHRs and 12 weeks postoperatively in Dahl rats. CGN therapy destroyed ganglion cell structure and significantly inhibited celiac ganglia nerve viability. Four and twelve weeks after CGN, the plasma renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels were markedly attenuated, and the nitric oxide content was significantly increased in the CGN group compared with the respective sham surgery rats. However, CGN did not result in statistical difference in malondialdehyde levels compared with sham surgery in both strains. The CGN has efficacy in reducing high blood pressure and may be an alternative for resistant hypertension. Minimally invasive endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac ganglia neurolysis (EUS-CGN) and percutaneous CGN are safe and convenient treatment approaches. Moreover, for hypertensive patients who need surgery due to abdominal disease or pain relief from pancreatic cancer, intraoperative CGN or EUS-CGN will be a good choice for hypertension therapy.

        "Abstract": "Gluten intolerance is associated with several disorders in the body. Although research has grown in recent years, the understanding of its impact on different tissues and the effects of physical exercise in mitigating health problems in the condition of gluten intolerance are still limited. Therefore, our objective was to test whether gliadin would affect metabolism and inflammation in liver tissue and whether aerobic physical exercise would mitigate the negative impacts of gliadin administration in rodents. Wistar rats were divided into exercised gliadin, gliadin, and control groups. Gliadin was administered by gavage from birth to 60 days of age. The rats in the exercised gliadin group performed an aerobic running exercise training protocol for 15 days. At the end of the experiments, physiological, histological, and molecular analyzes were performed in the study. Compared to the control group, the gliadin group had impaired weight gain and increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and inflammatory biomarkers in the liver. On the other hand, compared to the gliadin group, animals in the exercise-gliadin group had a recovery in body weight, improved insulin sensitivity, and a reduction in some gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and inflammatory biomarkers in the liver. In conclusion, our results revealed that the administration of gliadin from birth impaired weight gain and induced an increase in hepatic inflammatory cytokines, which was associated with an impairment of glycemic homeostasis in the liver, all of which were attenuated by adding aerobic exercise training in the gliadin group.",

Although there are many case reports associated with olmesartan-related enteropathy in humans, it has not been described in a long-term animal model study so far.

In this study, an artificial hypertension model was established with a dose of 185 \u03bcmol /kg L-NAME (N \u03c9-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) twice in a day intraperitoneally in Wistar albino rats. To determine and compare side effects, the OM-Suspension and OM-SMEDDS were administered at 1.3 mg/kg therapeutic dose during one-month period to the rats. Tension of rats was recorded by measuring from their tails with non invasive blood pressure system. We observed celiac like enteropathy findings like villous atrophy and intraepithelial lymphocytosis and clinical changes like weight loss and severe diarrhea after the treatment with OM-Suspension during one-month experiment. It was also observed that the antihypertensive efficacy of the OM-SMEDDS formulation was higher than the suspension during the experiment, which did not cause enteropathy, diarrhea and weight loss by reducing intestinal exposure. Hereby, we evaluated the side effects of two different pharmaceutical forms by designing a sustainable and reproducible celiac rat model that can be induced with olmesartan medoxomil.",

        "Abstract": "What is the central question of this study? Does peripheral non-invasive focused ultrasound targeted to the celiac plexus improve inflammatory bowel disease? What is the main finding and its importance? Peripheral non-invasive focused ultrasound targeted to the celiac plexus in a rat model of ulcerative colitis improved stool consistency and reduced stool bloodiness, which coincided with a longer and healthier colon than in animals without focused ultrasound treatment. The findings suggest that this novel neuromodulatory technology could serve as a plausible therapeutic approach for improving symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease. Individuals suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experience significantly diminished quality of life. Here, we aim to stimulate the celiac plexus with non-invasive peripheral focused ultrasound (FUS) to modulate the enteric cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. This approach may have clinical utility as an efficacious IBD treatment given the non-invasive and targeted nature of this therapy. We employed the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of colitis, administering lower (5%) and higher (7%) doses to rats in drinking water. FUS on the celiac plexus administered twice a day for 12 consecutive days to rats with severe IBD improved stool consistency scores from 2.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 to 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0 with peak efficacy on day 5 and maximum reduction in gross bleeding scores from 1.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 to 0.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 on day 6. Similar improvements were seen in animals in the low dose DSS group, who received FUS only once daily for 12\u00a0days. Moreover, animals in the high dose DSS group receiving FUS twice daily maintained colon length (17.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0cm), while rats drinking DSS without FUS exhibited marked damage and shortening of the colon (13.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0cm) as expected. Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17, tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3 were reduced with DSS but coincided with control levels after FUS, which is plausibly due to a loss of colon crypts in the former and healthier crypts in the latter. Lastly, overall, these results suggest non-invasive FUS of peripheral ganglion can deliver precision therapy to improve IBD symptomology.",

Telmisartan, a second class RAAS inhibitors, did not affect ACE2 levels. We have also tested other cardiovascular medications that may be used alone, or in combination with RAAS inhibitors. Some of these medications increased TMPRSS2, while others, like furosemide, significantly reduced COVID-19 receptors. The increase in ACE2 expression levels could be due to chronic use of RAAS inhibitors or alternatively caused by other hypertension-related factors or presence of other comorbidities. Treatment of common co-morbidities often require chronic use of multiple medications, which may result in an additive increase in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Our data suggest that more research is needed to determine the effect of different medications, as well as medication combinations, on COVID-19 receptors.",

        "Abstract": "Seeds of Ipomoea hederacea Jacq. (family: Convolvulaceae) are traditionally used to treat high blood pressure and cardiac diseases. Present study was conducted to validate the traditional claim and explore the possible mechanism(s) of antihypertensive effects of I. hederacea. Aqueous-ethanolic extract and activity based fractions of I. hederacea were evaluated using invasive blood pressure measuring technique, isolated tissue experiments, fructose induced hypertension/metabolic syndrome and biochemical analysis.Phytochemical analysis of active fraction was performed with aim to identify chemical composition of I. hederacea seeds. LC-MS analysis was also performed to identify the compounds proposed to be present in active fraction of I. hederacea seeds. Crude extract/fractions of I. hederacea showed dose (0.01-100\u00a0mg/kg) dependent significant hypotensive effect in normotensive anesthetized rats, similar to verapamil (0.01-30\u00a0mg/kg). Pretreatment with hexamethonium and atropine mediated no significant changes in hypotensive effect of butanol fraction of I. hederacea (Ih.Bn) at 3\u00a0mg/kg dose. However, a significant decrease in the hypotensive effect of Ih.Bn 3\u00a0mg/kg (-34.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.36%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) was observed in the presence of L-NAME (20\u00a0mg/kg). Similarly, Ih.Bn (3\u00a0mg/kg) showed no significant effect on angiotensin-II response. However, response of phenylephrine (45.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.63%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and dobutamine (18.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.10%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) was significantly decreased in the presence of Ih.Bn 3\u00a0mg/kg. Ih.Bn also exhibited dose dependent (0.01-100\u00a0mg/kg) antihypertensive effect in fructose induced hypertensive rats, similar to verapamil (0.01-30\u00a0mg/kg). Concomitant treatment with Ih.Bn (3, 10 and 30\u00a0mg/kg) for six weeks showed a dose dependent profound protection with significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) effect at 30\u00a0mg/kg against fructose induced basal mean arterial pressure (142.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.62\u00a0mmHg). Ih.Bn did not significantly change response of PE, Ang-II and Epi was observed in invasive and ex vivo techniques. However, Ih.Bn significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) prevented against decrease in vascular response of acetylcholine in anesthetized rats and in isolated aorta of rat. A significant dose dependent decrease in triglyceride and glucose level (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and increase in HDL level (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) was observed in Ih.Bn treated groups. Results of LC-MS analysis of Ih.Bn showed the presence of 24 compounds that belong to different chemical classes, including carboxylic acid, flavonoids, oligopeptides and tripeptide that are known to have antihypertensive and vasorelaxant properties. Results of present study indicate the presence of hypotensive/antihypertensive effect in crude extract/fractions of I. hederacea with most potent effect shown by butanol fraction (Ih.Bn), possibly mediated through \u03b1<sub>1</sub> blocking, \u03b2 blocking and iNOS/cGMP stimulating activity.",

        "Abstract": "Short stature (SS) is a common manifestation of celiac disease (CD). After starting gluten free diet (GFD), children usually have catch-up growth (improvement in height SDS of >1 SD). However, few children in remission, even on GFD, lack catch up growth. This study was planned to assess the growth hormone (GH) axis and the prevalence of anti-pituitary antibodies in such patients. It was a single-centre, prospective study. Patients with CD in remission for the last 1 y, having SS and lacking catch-up growth, were included after excluding other common causes of SS. GH dynamics were studied using stimulation tests: Insulin tolerance test, clonidine stimulation test, and glucagon stimulation test. GH deficiency (GHD) was defined as non-stimulable response to 2 GH stimulation tests. Anti-pituitary antibodies were analysed in these patients using rat pituitary extract as antigen. Ten patients (8 girls), with a mean age of 10\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8 y, in serological remission for CD and lacking catch-up growth, were enrolled. All had a height SDS of < -2. Fifteen age matched children with CD and adequate catch up growth served as controls. GHD was seen in 7 patients (70%), out of whom 2 received GH therapy and had an improvement in the height SDS from -2.7 to -1.4 and from -2.1 to 2.4 (over 1 y), respectively. Anti-pituitary antibodies were seen in significant titres in 55.5% of the cases and 40% of the controls. Children with CD in remission but lacking catch-up growth should be evaluated for GHD.",

        "Abstract": "Depression and coronary heart disease (CHD) often occur together in clinical practice. As a traditional Chinese medicine, Kai-Xin-San (KXS) has been widely used for the treatment of emotion-related disorders. In the present study, we aimed to explore whether KXS had both antidepressive effects and cardioprotective functions in a rat model of myocardial ischemia (MI) with depression. A total of 50 SD rats were randomly assigned into five groups as follows: normal control (control group), celiac injection of isopropyl adrenaline (ISO) (MI group), depression (depression group), MI+ depression (model group) and MI+ depression treated with intragastric administration of 370 mg/kg KXS (KXS group). MI was induced by subcutaneous injection of 85 mg/kg ISO. Depression was developed by a 7-week chronic mild stress (CMS) challenge. Behavioral test was conducted before and during the experiment. Echocardiography and biochemical analysis were carried out after 7 weeks of CMS challenge. After 7 weeks of experiment, depression-like behaviors were observed in all the groups except for control and KXS groups, and KXS treatment dramatically increased open-field test scores and sucrose consumption (P < 0.01 vs. model group). Echocardiography and biochemical analysis showed that KXS treatment could improve levels of ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), which were reduced by depression and ISO challenge. Meanwhile, KXS treatment significantly decreased the levels of creation kinase MB (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which were increased in the model group. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), catalase (CAT) were increased, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) activity was significantly decreased in the KXS group. Moreover, KXS treatment reduced the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in myocardial tissue compared with the model group. KXS had antidepressant-like activity and offered cardioprotective effects against ISO-induced myocardial infarction with depression.",

        "Title": "Effect of common medications on the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors in liver tissue.",
        "Abstract": "Besides lung drastic involvement, SARS-CoV-2 severely affected other systems including liver. Emerging epidemiological studies brought the attentions towards liver injury and impairment as a potential outcome of COVID19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are the main cell entry receptors of SARS-CoV-2. We have tested the ability of medications to regulate expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Understanding that may reflect how such medications may affect the level of infectivity and permissibility of the liver following COVID-19. Using transcriptomic datasets, Toxicogenomic Project-Genomics Assisted Toxicity Evaluation System (Open TG-GATEs) and GSE30351, we have tested the ability of ninety common medications to regulate COVID-19 receptors expression in human primary hepatocytes. Most medications displayed a dose-dependent change in expression of receptors which could hint at a potentially more pronounced change with chronic use. The expression level of TMPRSS2 was increased noticeably with a number of medications such as metformin. Within the analgesics, acetaminophen revealed a dose-dependent reduction in expression of ACE2, while non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had mixed effect on receptors expression. To confirm the observed effects on primary human hepatocytes, rat hepatocyte treatments data was obtained from DrugMatrix toxicogenomic database (GSE57805), which showed a similar ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression pattern. Treatment of common co-morbidities often require chronic use of multiple medications, which may result in an additive increase in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. More research is needed to determine the effect of different medications on COVID-19 receptors.",

        "Abstract": "Disturbances in pancreatic microcirculation, beginning with vasoconstriction, are crucial in early pancreatitis and progression to necrotizing pancreatitis. Thus, vascular-targeted treatment aiming to restore a sufficient level of microcirculation through vasodilation would possibly reduce the severity of pancreatitis. Lidocaine is an anti-arrhythmic and local anesthetic drug, which also acts as a vasodilator at higher concentrations. To evaluate the efficacy of intra-arterial infusion of lidocaine into the celiac trunk in treatment of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. Wistar rats (n = 20) were randomly divided into 2 equal groups: the control group (NaCl group, n = 10) and the study group (lidocaine group, n = 10). All subjects underwent surgical intervention with intra-arterial infusion of 0.9% NaCl (control group) or 1% lidocaine hydrochloride (study group) into the celiac trunk. Blood samples were collected 5 times at regular intervals from each rat for amylase and lipase measurements. Histopathological analysis of the pancreas was performed. A total number of 16 rats (control group n = 7, study group n = 9) were included. In the postoperative course, the study group (lidocaine group) revealed lower values of serum amylase and lipase levels compared to the control group (NaCl group), except the values at the 1st treatment point, which appeared 1 h after intraoperative drug injection. Significantly lower treatment endpoint levels of pancreatic enzymes were seen in the lidocaine group. Moreover, no differences were observed between the 1st and the last treatment point in the control group; however, these differences were significant for both enzymes in the study group. Histopathology revealed reduced pancreatitis severity in the study group compared to the controls. Intra-arterial lidocaine infusion into the celiac trunk decreases pancreatitis severity. What is more, this study demonstrates the relevance of early vasodilation in the therapy of acute pancreatitis.",

        "Abstract": "The roots of Ribes orientale (Family Grossulariaceae) have long been used as a folk remedy to treat rheumatism and joints pain in Northern Areas of Pakistan. The purpose of study was to observe the preventive efficacy of roots of Ribes orientale (RO) aqueous ethanolic extract (30:70) and its aqueous and n-butanol fractions in treating rheumatoid arthritis and to determine its possible mechanism of action. Arthritis was evaluated in vitro using heat induced bovine serum albumin and egg albumin denaturation and membrane stabilizing assays at 50-6400\u202f\u03bcg/ml concentration of extract/fractions whereas, in vivo arthritis was evaluated at 50, 100, 200\u202fmg/kg doses of extract/fractions in formaldehyde model by measuring rat paw volume/diameter. Moreover, highest effective dose (200\u202fmg/kg) of extract/fractions was evaluated in Fre\u00fcnd complete adjuvant (FCA) model. Arthritis was induced in Sprague Dawley rats by immunization with 0.1\u202fml FCA in left footpad. RO extract/fractions at 200\u202fmg/kg were orally administered from day 0, 30\u202fmin prior to adjuvant injection and sustained for 28 days. Paw volume/diameter, arthritic score, body weight, and hematological (WBC, RBC, ESR, Hb and Platelet count) and biochemical (AST, ALT, ALP, urea, creatinine, CRP and RF) parameters were observed. The mRNA expression levels of COX-2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, NF-kB, TNF-\u03b1, IL-4 and IL-10 were measured by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) whereas, PGE2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in serum samples were measured by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, radiographs of hind paws and histological changes in ankle joint were analyzed in adjuvant injected rats. The anti-oxidant activity of plant extract and fractions was evaluated using DPPH and reducing power assays. In addition, phytochemistry, total phenolic and flavonoid contents, and HPLC analysis of most active fraction (aqueous fraction) were performed. Results showed that RO extract and fractions (notably aqueous fraction) significantly reduced protein denaturation and protected erythrocyte membrane in concentration dependent manner. Similarly, extract/fractions induced dose-dependent decrease in paw volume/diameter in the formaldehyde model. Plant extract and fractions significantly suppressed paw swelling and arthritic score, prevented cachexia and remarkably ameliorated hematological and biochemical changes. Furthermore, RO extract/fractions downregulated gene expression levels of PGE2, COX-2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, NF-kB and TNF-\u03b1 whereas, upregulated those of IL-4 and IL-10, compared with FCA control rats. The radiographic and histopathologic improvement in joint architecture was also observed in RO treated rats. Piroxicam, used as reference drug, also significantly suppressed arthritis. Additionally, plant exhibited notable anti-oxidant activity and phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of flavonoids and polyphenols. Results indicated that suppression of pro-inflammatory enzymes/cytokines, inhibition of protein denaturation, lysosomal membrane stabilizing abilities, and redox/free radical scavenging properties of RO extract and fractions support anti-arthritic and immunomodulatory property of Ribes orientale that might be due to its polyphenolic and flavonoid constituents. This suggests that Ribes orientale roots may be used as a therapeutic agent for treating human arthritis.",

        "Abstract": "The sites of action regulating meal size (MS) and intermeal interval (IMI) length by glucagon like peptide-1 (7-36) (GLP-1 (7-36)) and cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8) reside in the areas supplied by the two major branches of the abdominal aorta, celiac and cranial mesenteric arteries. We hypothesized that infusing GLP-1 near those sites reduces body weight (BW) and adding CCK-8 to this infusion enhances the reduction. Here, we measured BW in diet-induced obese (DIO) male rats maintained and tested on normal rat chow and infused with saline, GLP-1 (0.5nmol/kg) and GLP-1+CCK-8 (0.5nmol/kg each) in the aorta once daily for 21days. We found that GLP-1 and GLP-1+CCK-8 decrease BW relative to saline vehicle and GLP-1+CCK-8 reduced it more than GLP-1 alone. Reduction of BW by GLP-1 alone was accompanied by decreased 24-h food intake, first MS, duration of first meal and number of meals, and an increase in latency to first meal. Reduction of BW by the combination of the peptides was accompanied by decrease 24-h food intake, first MS, duration of first meal and number of meals, and increase in the IMI length, satiety ratio and latency to first meal. In conclusion, GLP-1 reduces BW and CCK-8 enhances this reduction if the peptides are given near their sites of action.",

        "Abstract": "Type 1 diabetes is associated with abberations of fat metabolism before and after the clinical onset of disease. It has been hypothesized that the absence of the effect of insulin in the liver contributes to reduced hepatic fat synthesis. We measured hepatic gene expression and serum metabolites before and after the onset of hyperglycemia in a BioBreeding rat model of type 1 diabetes. Functional pathway annotation identified that lipid metabolism was differentially expressed in hyperglycemic rats and that these pathways significantly overlapped with genes regulated by insulin. 17 serum metabolites significantly changed in concentration. All but 2 of the identified metabolites had previously been reported in type 1 diabetes, and carbohydrates were overall the most upregulated class of metabolites. We conclude that lack of insulin in the liver contributes to the changes in fat metabolism observed in type 1 diabetes. Further studies are needed to understand the clinical consequences of a lack of insulin in the liver in patients with type 1 diabetes.",

GRP-10 reduced MS, prolonged the IMI, and increased the SR only in the RYGB group, whereas GRP-29 evoked these responses by both routes and in both groups.

The present study was aimed to investigate the analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet properties of B. crispa. Male rats (220-270 gm,) and mice (25-30 gm) were randomly divided into different groups (n\u2009=\u20096). Various doses of plant extract of B. crispa, its fractions and pure compounds isolated from the plant were administered intraperitoneally (i.p). The analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet activities were assessed using acetic acid and formalin-induced nociception in mice, carrageenan-induced rat paw edema and arachidonic acid-induced platelets aggregation tests. The intraperitoneal administration of the methanolic extract (50 and 100 mg/kg), hexane fraction (10 and 25 mg/kg i.p) exhibited significant inhibition (P\u2009<\u20090.01) of the acetic acid-induced writhing in mice and attenuated formalin-induced reaction time of animals in second phase of the test. Pure compounds BdI-2, BdI-H3 and BH-3 isolated from B. crispa produced significant (P\u2009<\u20090.01) analgesic activity in acetic acid-induced and formalin tests. The crude extract of B. crispa (50-200 mg/kg i.p.) and its hexane fraction inhibited carrageenan-induced rat paw edema with maximum inhibition of 65 and 71% respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.01). The analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect of the plant extract and isolated pure compounds were comparable to diclofenac sodium. B. crispa plant extract (0.5-2.5 mg/mL) produced significant anti-platelet effect (P\u2009<\u20090.01) with maximum inhibition of 78% at 2.5 mg/ml. The findings from our present study suggest that B. crispa possesses analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet properties.

        "Abstract": "This chapter provides a brief overview of current animal models for studying celiac disease, with a focus on generating HLA transgenic mouse models. Human Leukocyte Antigen class II molecules have been a particular target for transgenic mice due to their tight association with celiac disease, and a number of murine models have been developed which had the endogenous MHC class II genes replaced with insertions of disease susceptible HLA class II alleles DQ2 or DQ8. Additionally, transgenic mice that overexpress interleukin-15 (IL-15), a key player in the inflammatory cascade that leads to celiac disease, have also been generated to model a state of chronic inflammation. To explore the contribution of specific bacteria in gluten-sensitive enteropathy, the nude mouse and rat models have been studied in germ-free facilities. These reductionist mouse models allow us to address single factors thought to have crucial roles in celiac disease. No single model has incorporated all of the multiple factors that make up celiac disease. Rather, these mouse models can allow the functional interrogation of specific components of the many stages of, and contributions to, the pathogenic mechanisms that will lead to gluten-dependent enteropathy. Overall, the tools for animal studies in celiac disease are many and varied, and provide ample space for further creativity as well as to characterize the complete and complex pathogenesis of celiac disease.",

A reduction of 82% in toxicity, as determined by the rat-liver lysosome assay, was achieved using 0.03% enzyme on weight of dough. Without enzyme, only 26% reduction occurred. The difference in reduction of toxicity achieved is statistically significant (p < 0.01). The results are very similar to those obtained in our previous work using an immuno assay and the same enzyme preparation. They confirm the value of caricain as a means of reducing the toxicity of gliadin and open the way for enzyme therapy as an adjunct to the gluten free diet.

        "Abstract": "To assess anti-neuronal antibodies (NA) prevalence and their correlation with neurological disorders and bowel habits in celiac disease (CD) patients. Neurological manifestations are estimated to occur in about 10% of celiac disease patients and NA to central nervous system (CNS) and enteric nervous system (ENS) are found in a significant proportion of them. Little is known about the clinical and immunological features in CD patients with neurological manifestations. NA to CNS and ENS were investigated in 106 CD patients and in 60 controls with autoimmune disorders by indirect immunofluorescence on rat / primate cerebellar cortex and intestinal (small and large bowel) sections. IgG NA to CNS (titer 1:50 - 1:400) were positive in 23 celiacs (21%), being more frequently detected in those with neurological disorders that in those without neurological dysfunction (49% vs. 8%, P< 0.0001). Of the 26 celiacs (24%) with IgG NA to ENS, 11 out of 12 with an antibody titer > 1:200 had severe constipation. Only one patient with cerebellar ataxia and intestinal sub-occlusion was positive for NA to CNS and ENS. NA to CNS and ENS were found in 7% and 5% of controls, respectively. In CD the positivity of NA to CNS can be regarded as a marker of neurological manifestations. High titer NA to ENS are associated with severe constipation. The demonstration of NA to CNS and ENS suggests an immune-mediated pathogenesis leading to central neural impairment as well as gut dysfunction (hence constipation), respectively.",

Body mass, mass of celiac fat, celiac fat/body mass were measured. Methylation of Tsc1 promoter, mRNA and protein expression of mTOR were detected by bisulfite sequencing method, RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Mass of celiac fat, celiac fat/body mass were higher in food-induced rat than that in control group. There were 11 methylation sites in SD rat hypothalamus. Obese group has significantly higher methylation rates (94.50% +/- 4.66%) than that of control group (86.60% +/- 3.49%) (P<0.002). The mRNA and protein expression of mTOR were noted lower in control group than in obese group (P<0.05).

This study aims to investigate its protective effect in celiac disease induced in rats. Twenty-four rat pups were divided into 4 groups as follows: control, disease (1.5 mg/g intragastric gliadin), co-treatment (50 ng/g intraperitoneal ghrelin after gliadin gavage) and pretreatment (50 ng/g intraperitoneal ghrelin before gliadin gavage). Animals' weight gain was charted. Histological features assessed include villus length, villus width, crypt depth and number of intraepithelial lymphocytes. Tissue interferon-gamma was quantified by ELISA. ANOVA was used to compare results statistically. Results showed that villi were shortened in the diseased group, but were as long as the control in pretreatment and co-treatment groups. Crypt depth had increased in disease group, but turned to normal in co-treatment group. Number of intraepithelial lymphocytes was significantly higher in disease group than the control, while no difference was observed between co-treatment and control groups. Disease and control animals weighed equally at the end of the experiment, but ghrelin-treated animals had significantly gained more weight than these two. Interferon-gamma measurement revealed no significant difference among groups. We concluded administration of ghrelin led to histological improvement of celiac disease which was more obvious if administered after exposure to gliadin.",

        "Abstract": "This study was aimed to establish a stable animal model of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) to provide theoretical and experimental basis for understanding the development of LVH. The abdominal aorta of male Wistar rats (80-100 g) was constricted to a diameter of 0.55 mm between the branches of the celiac and anterior mesenteric arteries. Echocardiography using a linear phased array probe was performed as well as pathological examination and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) measurement at 3, 4 and 6 weeks after abdominal aortic constriction (AAC). The results showed that the acute mortality rate (within 24 h) of this modified rat model was 8%. Animals who underwent AAC demonstrated significantly increased interventricular septal (IVS), LV posterior wall (LVPWd), LV mass index (LVMI), cross-sectional area (CSA) of myocytes, and perivascular fibrosis; the ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), and cardiac output (CO) were consistently lower at each time point after AAC. Notably, differences in these parameters between AAC group and sham group were significant by 3 weeks and reached peaks at 4th week. Following AAC, the plasma BNP was gradually elevated compared with the sham group at 3rd and 6th week. It was concluded that this modified AAC model can develop LVH, both stably and safely, by week four post-surgery; echocardiography is able to assess changes in chamber dimensions and systolic properties accurately in rats with LVH.",

The edema degree, the level of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, PGE2, NO and MDA and the activity of SOD in serum were detected. Through cell culture, the effects of the medicine on AA rat's splenic cell's multiplication capacity were studied. The influence of celiac macrophage cell culture fluid of AA rats' on C57BL/6J mice thymic cell multiplication capacity under the medicine was evaluated. Wuweifengshi capsule showed an inhibiting function on the level of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, PGE2, NO and increased the activity of SOD in serum, but showed no significant influence on MDA. It also inhibited the AA rat's splenic cell's multiplication capacity and the influence of celiac macrophage cell culture fluid of AA rat's on C57BL/6J mice thymic cell multiplication capacity. The anti-AA effect of Wuweifengshi capsule is possibly due to its inhibition of relevant cytokines and its adjustment of corresponding enzyme's activity and immunization organ's cell multiplication capacity.",

        "Abstract": "The Brunner's glands of the proximal duodenum exert barrier functions through secretion of glycoproteins and antimicrobial peptides. However, ion transporter localization, function, and regulation in the glands are less clear. Mapping the subcellular distribution of transporters is an important step toward elucidating trafficking mechanisms of fluid transport in the gland. The present study examined 1) changes in the distribution of intestinal anion transporters and the aquaporin 5 (AQP5) water channel in rat Brunner's glands following second messenger activation and 2) anion transporter distribution in Brunner's glands from healthy and disease-affected human tissues. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), AQP5, sodium-potassium-coupled chloride cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter (NBCe1), and the proton pump vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) were localized to distinct membrane domains and in endosomes at steady state. Carbachol and cAMP redistributed CFTR to the apical membrane. cAMP-dependent recruitment of CFTR to the apical membrane was accompanied by recruitment of AQP5 that was reversed by a PKA inhibitor. cAMP also induced apical trafficking of V-ATPase and redistribution of NKCC1 and NBCe1 to the basolateral membranes. The steady-state distribution of AQP5, CFTR, NBCe1, NKCC1, and V-ATPase in human Brunner's glands from healthy controls, cystic fibrosis, and celiac disease resembled that of rat; however, the distribution profiles were markedly attenuated in the disease-affected duodenum. These data support functional transport of chloride, bicarbonate, water, and protons by second messenger-regulated traffic in mammalian Brunner's glands under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.",

        "Abstract": "The sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in some forms of human hypertension as well as the Dahl salt-sensitive rat model of hypertension; however, the sympathetic targets involved remain unclear. To address this, we examined the role of the renal and splanchnic sympathetic nerves in Dahl hypertension by performing sham surgery (n=10) or targeted sympathetic ablation of the renal nerves (renal denervation, n=11), the splanchnic nerves (celiac ganglionectomy, n=11), or both renal and splanchnic nerves (n=11) in hypertensive Dahl rats. Mean arterial pressure increased from \u2248120 mm Hg, while on a 0.1% sodium chloride diet, to \u2248140 mm Hg after being fed a 4.0% sodium chloride diet for 3 weeks. At that point, rats underwent sham or targeted sympathetic ablation. Four weeks after treatment, mean arterial pressure was lower in renal denervated (150.4\u00b110.4) and celiac ganglionectomized (147.0\u00b16.1) rats compared with sham rats (165.0\u00b13.7) and even lower in rats that underwent both ablations (128.4\u00b16.6). There were no differences in heart rate or fluid balance between sham and renal denervated rats; however, rats that underwent either celiac ganglionectomy or both ablations exhibited marked tachycardia as well as sodium and water retention after treatment. These data suggest that targeted sympathetic ablation is an effective treatment for established hypertension in the Dahl rat and that the kidneys and the splanchnic vascular bed are both independently important targets of the sympathetic nervous system in this model.",

The aim of this study was to assess IgA-AAA with a commercial test that uses sections of rat intestinal epithelial cells in a well-selected cohort of patients and to evaluate the relationship between the presence of serum IgA-AAA and the severity of intestinal mucosa damage. Serum samples from 70 CD patients and 150 controls subjects were analyzed retrospectively for the presence of IgA-AAA. The indirect immunofluorescence test that we used has a specificity of 100%; the sensitivity of the test is not high (25.7%). In this study we also show that serum AAA are more frequently positive in CD patients with total IVA (77.8%) and that this association is significant IgA-AAA certainly cannot take the place of much more sensitive tests such as a-tTG and EMA in the diagnosis of CD because of their low sensitivity; nonetheless, these antibodies could be determined in a-tTG and/or EMA positive patients who cannot undergo an intestinal biopsy because of a severe contraindication, or in the case of negative consensus regarding endoscopy, or when the histology interpretation is difficult. In conclusion, the IFI commercial test with intestinal epithelial cells as substrate offers a useful method for IgA-AAA determination. Serum IgA-AAA positivity is indicative of more severe intestinal histology damage and their assay could be a real help to the clinician, especially in the complicated cases.",

This study was designed to investigate the gastroprotective effect of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) on gastric mucosal lesions induced by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats and to determine the possible mechanism involved. Fifty-sex male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into sham, control (I/R injury), propargylglycine (PAG)-, L-cysteine-, and NaHS-treated groups. To induce I/R lesions, the celiac artery was first clamped for 30 min (ischemia phase), followed by removal of the clamp artery to allow reperfusion for 3 h. Treated rats received PAG [50 mg/kg, intravenous (i.v.)] or NaHS (160, 320, or 640 ng/kg, i.v.) 5 min before reperfusion. The effect of L-cysteine pretreatment was also investigated. Plasma levels of cytokines and cortisol were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The gastric tissue samples were collected to quantify the mRNA expression of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and transforming growth factor (TGF-\u03b2) by quantitative real-time PCR. The total area of gastric lesions significantly decreased following the administration of NaHS and L-cysteine. The highest area of mucosal lesions was observed in PAG-treated rats. The mRNA expression and plasma levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly decreased in L-cysteine- and NaHS-treated rats in a dose-dependent manner. Slightly increased levels of TGF-\u03b2 were observed in these test groups, but the difference was not statistically significant compared with the other groups. The plasma level of cortisol was also not affected by NaHS treatment. Our findings indicate that a possible mechanism for the gastroprotective effect of H(2)S could be through the decreased mRNA expression and plasma release of proinflammatory cytokines.",

        "Abstract": "Antibodies against the wheat storage globulin Glo-3A from a patient with both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease were enriched to identify potential molecular mimicry between wheat antigens and T1D target tissues. Recombinant Glo-3A was used to enrich anti-Glo-3A immunoglobulin G antibodies from plasma by batch affinity chromatography. Rat jejunum and pancreas, as well as human duodenum and monocytes were probed, and binding was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Glo-3A-enriched antibodies bound to a specific subset of cells in the lamina propria of rat jejunum that co-localized mostly with a marker of resident, alternatively activated CD163-positive (CD163\u207a) macrophages. Blood monocytes and macrophage-like cells in human duodenum were also labelled with the enriched antibodies. Blocking studies revealed that binding to CD163\u207a macrophages was not due to cross-reactivity with anti-Glo-3A antibodies, but rather to non-Glo-3A antibodies co-purified during antibody enrichment. The novel finding of putative autoantibodies against tolerogenic intestinal CD163\u207a macrophages suggests that regulatory macrophages were targeted in this patient with celiac disease and T1D.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine that is induced by dietary wheat gluten proteins (gliadins) in genetically predisposed individuals. The overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria and infections has been suggested to contribute to CD pathogenesis. We aimed to study the effects of gliadin and various intestinal bacterial strains on mucosal barrier integrity, gliadin translocation, and cytokine production. Changes in gut mucosa were assessed in the intestinal loops of inbred Wistar-AVN rats that were reared under germ-free conditions in the presence of various intestinal bacteria (enterobacteria and bifidobacteria isolated from CD patients and healthy children, respectively) and CD-triggering agents (gliadin and IFN-\u03b3) by histology, scanning electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and a rat cytokine antibody array. Adhesion of the bacterial strains to the IEC-6 rat cell line was evaluated in vitro. Gliadin fragments alone or together with the proinflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 significantly decreased the number of goblet cells in the small intestine; this effect was more pronounced in the presence of Escherichia coli CBL2 and Shigella CBD8. Shigella CBD8 and IFN-\u03b3 induced the highest mucin secretion and greatest impairment in tight junctions and, consequently, translocation of gliadin fragments into the lamina propria. Shigella CBD8 and E. coli CBL2 strongly adhered to IEC-6 epithelial cells. The number of goblet cells in small intestine increased by the simultaneous incubation of Bifidobacterium bifidum IATA-ES2 with gliadin, IFN-\u03b3 and enterobacteria. B. bifidum IATA-ES2 also enhanced the production of chemotactic factors and inhibitors of metalloproteinases, which can contribute to gut mucosal protection. Our results suggest that the composition of the intestinal microbiota affects the permeability of the intestinal mucosa and, consequently, could be involved in the early stages of CD pathogenesis.",

However, little is known about the effects of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on gastric mucosa injuries induced by gastric ischemia reperfusion. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the protective effects and mechanism of CGRP on gastric mucosa injury after gastric ischemia reperfusion in rats. Thirty-six healthy Wistar rats were randomly divided into CGRP-treated, sham-operated, and control groups. Twelve rats were involved in each group. These groups were further divided into 24-h and 48-h subgroups. Gastric ischemia reperfusion injury (GI-RI) rat model was established by a 30-min celiac artery occlusion by an artery clamp, followed by 24\u2009h or 48\u2009h of reperfusion. CGRP (1\u2009\u03bcg/ml) at the dose of 3\u2009\u03bcg/kg was given intraperiloneally (IP) at the beginning of reperfusion for rats in CGRP-treated group. Saline as vehicle (3\u2009ml/kg body weight), IP, was administered at the beginning of reperfusion for rats in control group. Sham-operated animals were subjected to an operation without GI-RI. Twenty-four hours or 48\u2009h after operation, the samples were taken out and processed for calculating stomach mucous membrane damage index according to Guth method, detecting pathological changes of gastric mucosa tissue by light microscopy and observing the expression of gastrin (Gas) and somatostatin (SST) by immunohistochemical staining. The results showed the following: (i) gastric mucosa with diffuse edema, splinter hemorrhage and erosion, numerous endothelial cells necrosis, mucosa dissociation, and infiltration of inflammatory cells were observed in both control and CGRP-treated animals, especially in the earlier period (24\u2009h) and then gradually healing. CGRP administration could reduce the damage of gastric mucosa. The injury index of gastric mucosa was lower in CGRP-treated group as compared with that in control group (P\u2009<\u20090.01). (ii) Gas expression in gastric antrum mucosa was lower in CGRP-treated group than that in control group (P\u2009<\u20090.01). SST expression in gastric antrum mucosa was higher in CGRP-treated group than that in control group (P\u2009<\u20090.01). It is concluded that CGRP regulated the secretion of Gas and SST and thus alleviated the damage of gastric mucosa induced by ischemia and reperfusion. CGRP might be a potential candidate for clinical therapy on modulating gastric mucosal protection and maintaining gastric mucosal integrity after ischemia and reperfusion of the stomach.",

Twenty biopsied and 25 not-biopsied subjects with negative tTG-Ab were tested as control groups. IgA-AAA assays were performed by indirect immunofluorescence using rat epithelial intestinal cells, and by ELISA with a commercial kit. tTG-Ab assay was a radio-binding assay. Intestinal specimens were collected by upper endoscopy and the histological study was done according to the Marsh's classification modified by Oberhuber (M/O). Auto-antibodies assays and histological evaluation have been performed blindly by skilled operators. CD diagnosis was confirmed in 82 patients (type I M/O in 2 patients, IIIA in 18 patients, IIIB in 29 patients and IIIC in 33 patients). Two patients with type 1 lesion in presence of positive tTG-Ab and abdominal complaints, started a gluten free diet. The rate of IgA-AAA positivity (sensitivity) by IFI and ELISA in histologically proven celiac disease patients, were 5.5% and 25% patients in IIIA, 27.5% and 34.4% patients in IIIB, 78.8% and 75% in IIIC patients, respectively.Patients with normal or nearly normal mucosa, regardless of tTG-Ab status, presented negative IgA-AAA IFI assay. On the other hand, 1 patient with normal mucosa but positive tTG-Ab, also presented positive IgA-AAA ELISA. All healthy non biopsied controls had negative IgA-AAA. tTG-Ab serum concentration was significantly correlated with more severe intestinal lesion (IIIB, IIIC M/O). IgA-AAA may be undetectable in presence of severe mucosal damage. Histology is still necessary to diagnose celiac disease and IgA-AAA cannot be included in usual screening tests, because it has little to offer if compared to the well-established tTG-Ab.IgA-AAA could be an adjunctive, very useful tool to support the diagnosis of CD in case of suboptimal histology, when the biopsy is to be avoided for clinical reasons, or in case of negative parents' consensus.",

        "Abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) is significantly elevated in the islets of animal models of diabetes. However, the molecular mechanism has not been clarified. We investigated whether the suppression of PGC-1alpha expression protects against beta-cell dysfunction in vivo and determined the mechanism of action of PGC-1alpha in beta-cells. The studies were performed in glucolipotixicity-induced primary rat islets and INS-1 cells. In vitro and in vivo approaches using adenoviruses were used to evaluate the role of PGC-1alpha in glucolipotoxicity-associated beta-cell dysfunction. The expression of PGC-1alpha in cultured beta-cells increased gradually with glucolipotoxicity. The overexpression of PGC-1alpha also suppressed the expression of the insulin and beta-cell E-box transcription factor (BETA2/NeuroD) genes, which was reversed by PGC-1alpha small interfering RNA (siRNA). BETA2/NeuroD, p300-enhanced BETA2/NeuroD, and insulin transcriptional activities were significantly suppressed by Ad-PGC-1alpha but were rescued by Ad-siPGC-1alpha. PGC-1alpha binding at the glucocorticoid receptor site on the BETA2/NeuroD promoter increased in the presence of PGC-1alpha. Ad-siPGC-1alpha injection through the celiac arteries of 90% pancreatectomized diabetic rats improved their glucose tolerance and maintained their fasting insulin levels. The suppression of PGC-1alpha expression protects the glucolipotoxicity-induced beta-cell dysfunction in vivo and in vitro. A better understanding of the functions of molecules such as PGC-1alpha, which play key roles in intracellular fuel regulation, could herald a new era of the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by providing protection from glucolipotoxicity, which is an important cause of the development and progression of the disease.",

        "Abstract": "It is not clear how the blocking effect of angiotensin II receptors by olmesartan affects the functional recovery of pressure-overload hypertrophied heart. Hypertrophied heart was created by abdominal aortic banding above the celiac artery in Wistar rats at the age of eight weeks. Hypertrophied heart was excised and studied at 10 and 16 weeks after the operation (HT groups). For the last four weeks before the experiment, olmesartan (0.2 mg/kg per day) was administered subcutaneously by osmotic minipumps (Olm groups). Left ventricular function was measured by Langendorff perfusion. The levels of mRNA for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) in myocardium were analyzed by RT-PCR. Left ventricular systolic (+dP/dt(max), left ventricular systolic pressure) and diastolic functions (-dP/dt(max), tau) were impaired in HT groups, while in Olm groups they were significantly improved. The left ventricle to body weight (LV/BW) ratio increased significantly in HT groups, but in Olm groups the LV/BW ratio decreased significantly in comparison with HT groups. The ACE2 mRNA level was significantly higher in Olm groups as compared with HT groups. Plasma angiotensin II and the ERK mRNA level in HT groups increased significantly, but decreased in Olm groups in comparison with HT groups significantly. Olmesartan improved left ventricular function and hypertrophy through the increase of the ACE2 mRNA and decrease of both angiotensin II and ERK mRNA in pressure-overload rat heart.",

        "Abstract": "Activation of small intestinal gluten-reactive CD4(+) T-cells is a critical event in celiac disease. Deamidation of specific glutamine residues by tissue transglutaminase enhances the binding of T-cell activating gliadin epitopes to DQ2, increasing T-cell recognition. Our purpose was to investigate whether deamidated gliadin epitopes can be generated in the small intestinal mucosa by tissue transglutaminase and to characterize the location of the process. Intestinal explants from pig intestine and frozen biopsy slices from human and rat intestine were incubated with alpha-gliadin peptides containing the immunodominant motif. Monoclonal antibodies specifically recognizing the non-deamidated and/or the deamidated epitope were used for immunofluorescence studies. We conclude that endogenous tissue transglutaminase can mediate extracellular deamidation of gliadin peptides in the lamina propria. Gliadin peptides with more than one recognition site can be simultaneously cross-linked and deamidated extracellularly in the lamina propria, and might be of importance for the antibody response seen in untreated celiac disease patients.",

The patient reported a history of recurrent pulmonary infections and intermittent intestinal symptoms in childhood. Wegner granulomatosis was initially suspected because of rhinopulmonary involvement. Serum's patient was tested for ANCA and anti-tissue antibodies. The latest test was performed on histological sections from rat and revealed the presence of anti-reticulin antibodies. Further testing, for anti-tissue transglutaminase and anti-endomysium antibodies, revealed positive results. Celiac disease was confirmed by histological examination of intestinal biopsy. Pulmonary symptoms were improved on a gluten free diet suggesting a causal relationship between celiac disease and respiratory symptoms.",

        "Title": "Validated sandwich ELISA for the quantification of tissue transglutaminase in tissue homogenates and cell lysates of multiple species.",
        "Abstract": "Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is a calcium dependent enzyme that displays diverse functions in various physiological processes. In addition to these physiological functions, there is strong evidence for the implication of tTG in a number of pathologies, including celiac disease, cancer and neurodegeneration. To explore the expression and function of tTG during (patho)physiological conditions, it is of utmost importance to have an assay that specifically measures tTG protein levels in various species and matrices. Therefore, we have developed a sensitive sandwich ELISA to measure tTG protein levels in tissue homogenates and cell lysates of human, rat and mouse origin. The ELISA uses commercially available antibodies, and human recombinant tTG as the standard protein. The limit of detection is 100 pg/ml; the coefficients of intra- and inter-assay variation range from 2.4% to 6.6% and from 12.7% to 15.1%, respectively. Clear detectable levels of tTG protein were measured in human and rat liver and cerebral cortex, as well as in brain-derived neuronal and glial cells. tTG levels in mouse tissues were much lower than observed in human and rat tissues. No cross-reactivity against keratinocyte TG (TG1), epidermal TG (TG3) or blood coagulation factor XIII was observed. The tTG specific sandwich ELISA presented in this paper is a sensitive and reliable tool to accurately measure tTG protein levels in different matrices (cell/tissue) of rat, mouse and human origin. It provides a better alternative for the widely used transglutaminase activity assay with respect to sensitivity and specificity, and may serve as a valuable tool to investigate protein expression levels as part of the approach to unravel the contribution of tTG to health and disease.",

        "Abstract": "Smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) with anti-F-actin specificity are commonly regarded as specific markers of type 1 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH-1) but, at the moment, a gold standard method for their identification is not available. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy for AIH-1 of three new methods of detecting anti-F-actin antibodies, and to compare the results with those obtained using the indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) method on rodent tissue. The sera of 33 AIH-1 patients and 104 controls (eight with type 2 AIH, 30 with chronic hepatitis C, 16 with celiac disease, 40 with primary biliary cirrhosis, and 10 with liver steatosis) were assayed for anti-F-actin antibodies using four methods: two IIF methods (one on rat tissue sections and the other on VSM 47 cell line derived from the thoracic aorta of rat embryo), an ELISA method and an Immunodot (ID) method. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were, respectively, 51.5, 95.2, 77.3 and 86.1% for IIF on the VSM 47 cell line; 63.6, 86.5, 60 and 88.2% for the ELISA method; 72.7, 82.7, 57.1 and 90.5% for the ID assay; and 57.6, 96.1, 82.6 and 87.7% for the IIF on rat tissue sections. The methods used for anti-F-actin antibody detection have different diagnostic performances. Both IIF methods, the one on rat tissues and the other on VSM47 cell line, are highly specific for AIH-1. In contrast, ELISA and especially ID show positive results in control population, although usually at low levels (with the single exception of PBC patients). Therefore, having a high positive predictive value, both IIF methods are reliable tools for the specific detection of AIH-associated anti-F-actin autoantibodies, whereas the immunometric assays might be integrated into the diagnostic scheme as second level tests upon improvement of their respective cut-offs to confirm anti-F-actin positivity in case of SMA positivity.",

        "Title": "In vivo and in vitro antioxidant activity of ghrelin: Attenuation of gastric ischemic injury in the rat.",
        "Abstract": "Gherlin, an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), is produced by stomach cells. It regulates food intake, gastric secretion and motility. However, its role as a protective agent in gastric ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to: (i) test the in vivo effect of peripherally administered ghrelin on gastric I/R-induced lesions in rats; and (ii) investigate in vitro the effect of ghrelin on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by human polymorphoneuclear (PMN) cells. The present study was carried out on three groups of rats (six per group): control (sham-operated), I/R (clamping of celiac artery for 30 min and reperfusion for 1 h), and I/R + ghrelin (200 ng/kg i.v., 15 min before ischemia and before reperfusion, respectively). Histological assessment of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections was performed and immunostaining with inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) antibody were performed on a gastric paraffin embedded section. Oxidative stress markers thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and glutathione (GSH) were measured in gastric tissue homogenates. Serum lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) was determined. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was assayed in gastric tissue homogenate. Gastric permeability was assessed calorimetrically using Evans blue dye. In vitro studies were carried out on isolated human PMN cells incubated with ghrelin and tested for ROS generation as measured by chemiluminecence (CL). Peripheral administration of ghrelin attenuated gastric injury by reducing ulceration, tissue congestion, cellular infiltration and vascular permeability. Serum level of LDH and tissue content of TNF-alpha were markedly reduced. A decrement in TBARS and an increment in GSH were observed. Ghrelin treatment attenuated iNOS protein expression which was upregulated by gastric ischemic injury. In vitro studies showed for the first time that ghrelin inhibited ROS generation by human PMN in a dose-dependent manner. These results provide evidence that peripherally administered ghrelin protects against gastric I/R injury. We also demonstrated that this protection is possibly accomplished through the antioxidant activity of ghrelin observed in vivo and in vitro.",

The DP rats display reduced weight gain prior to developing hyperglycemia, implying that metabolic events may precede diabetes onset. We tested the hypothesis that temperature measurements could serve as a physiological marker for the impending onset of hyperglycemia. Prior to the onset of hyperglycemia, brain, lower back, and intrascapular brown adipose tissue temperatures were analyzed by thermal signature analysis, which measures infrared emission from tissues. A thermocoupled rectal probe measured core temperature. In addition we performed a beta(3)-adrenergic receptor challenge test with the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor agonist BRL37344. DP rats displayed lower core temperature than DR rats prior to the onset of hyperglycemia. No temperature difference was detected in brain, lower back, or intrascapular brown adipose tissue between DP and DR rats. The beta(3)-adrenergic challenge showed that the rate of temperature increase after administration of BRL37344 was significantly higher (0.005 +/- 0.002 degrees C/min) in DP than in DR rats (P = 0.044). These studies reveal that the prediabetic DP rats fail to maintain core temperature and that they display increased sensitivity to heat production induced by a beta(3)-adrenergic receptor agonist. These studies suggest that body temperature as a measure of metabolic dysregulation is altered in the prediabetic DP rat prior to the onset of hyperglycemia.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac sprue is a multifactorial disease characterized by an inflammatory response to ingested gluten in the small intestine. Proteolytically resistant, proline- and glutamine-rich gluten peptides from wheat, rye, and barley persist in the intestinal lumen and elicit an immune response in genetically susceptible persons. We investigated a new combination enzyme product, consisting of a glutamine-specific endoprotease (EP-B2 from barley) and a prolyl endopeptidase (SC PEP from Sphingomonas capsulata), for its ability to digest gluten under gastric conditions. The ability of this combination enzyme to digest and detoxify whole-wheat bread gluten was investigated. In vitro and in vivo (rat) experimental systems were developed to simulate human gastric digestion, and the resulting material was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay, and patient-derived T-cell proliferation assays. The analysis revealed that EP-B2 extensively proteolyzes complex gluten proteins in bread, whereas SC PEP rapidly detoxifies the residual oligopeptide products of EP-B2 digestion. In vitro dose variation data suggests that an approximate 1:1 weight ratio of the 2 enzymes should maximize their synergistic potential. The efficacy of this 2-enzyme glutenase was verified in a rat model of gastric gluten digestion. By combining 2 enzymes with gastric activity and complementary substrate specificity, it should be possible to increase the safe threshold of ingested gluten, thereby ameliorating the burden of a highly restricted diet for patients with celiac sprue.",

        "Abstract": "Phage display antibody libraries have been made from the lymphocytes of patients suffering from autoimmune diseases in which the antibodies are known to play a role in the pathogenesis or are important for the diagnosis of the disease. In the case of Celiac Disease, the immune response is directed against the autoantigen tissue transglutaminase. However, despite numerous studies, the role of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of this disease has not been elucidated. We were able to engineer specific anti-transglutaminase antibody fragments in the form called \"miniantibody\". These are produced by genetic fusion of anti-tTG scFv to Human, Mouse or Rat Fc domains, making them suitable for in vivo expression. The results obtained here indicate that the miniantibody molecule is efficiently secreted, and that the reactivity to the antigen is retained even after fusion to heterologous Fc domains. Further analysis demonstrate that the molecule is secreted as homodimeric, mimicking original antibody structure. Finally, the in vivo expression in mice leads to detectable serum levels with no apparent gross immune response by the host. In this work we demonstrated the usefulness of a method for the in vivo expression of miniantibodies specific to transglutaminase, corresponding to the autoimmune specificity of Celiac Disease. This can be proposed as a general method to study the pathogenic role of autoimmune antibodies in autoimmune diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Spinal cord ischemia is one of the most dreaded complication which may occur after conventional surgery of the thoraco-abdominal aorta, as well as following endoprostheses implantation. A better understanding of its pathogeny and physiopathology may lead to the introduction of means or measures for its prevention. The widespread utilization of the endovascular management of thoraco-abdominal aortic pathology stimulated the search for new alternatives to overcome the problem. An experimental study was conducted, using Wistar-Lewis rats. Thirty-six animals were employed to assess the spinal cord consequences following the implantation of PTFE endoprosthesis in the thoraco-abdominal aorta. The endoprostheses were introduced through a distal aortotomy and advanced until the limits of the subclavian artery, down to the celiac axis. A similar group of animals underwent the conventional surgical management. To evaluate the neurologic repercussions, a sensor was placed in the spinal cord aimed at the registry of the bioelectric potentials, every two hours, until a limit of eight hours, in subgroups of six animals. Finally, the spinal cord was removed for histological examination. The collected data revealed that significant ischemic alterations occurred eight hours after the implantation of the endoprostheses and that 48 hours later some signs of recovery could be observed, probably by means of collateral blood flow arising from the spinal cord itself or from branches of the thoraco-abdominal vasculature. However, it must be stressed that these results were obtained in healthy animals, with normal arteries, and that the resistance of the nervous tissues to the ischemia is certainly lower than in individuals with previous arterial pathology.",

        "Abstract": "Gliadin digestion-resistant peptides are harmful in coeliac disease (CD), and initiate an autoimmune reaction that cause a cascade of symptoms. The role of the endogenous prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) is still not clear, and its activity over gliadin immunoactive peptides has not been fully established. Our objective was therefore to determine the endogenous POP protein level, tissue distribution and total activity in normal and CD epithelia, to evaluate tissue peptidase activity over gliadin peptides, and compare this with activities of mammalian POP and rat intestinal extracts. POP was assayed in biopsy preparations enzymatically and by Western blot analysis. Distribution was studied by immunohistochemistry using a specific POP antibody. Peptide cleavage was followed by mass spectroscopy-high-performance liquid chromatography (MS-HPLC). There was no difference in POP activity between normal and CD samples, but those from active CD subjects had an even higher ability to degrade the 33-mer peptide than those from treated CD and healthy humans. POP locates intracellularly in epithelia, similarly to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), but the latter is clearly found in normal microvilli but less so in diseased microvilli. Mammalian POP is unable to digest 33-mer peptide, which, conversely, is a POP inhibitor. Rat intestine is more effective than human intestine in cleaving the 33-mer peptide. However, the products are still harmful epitopes. A surplus of POP eliminates 12-mer and 19-mer peptide products. The results rule out a causative role of POP in the pathogenesis of CD and strongly suggest that other peptidases are needed to eliminate gliadin-derived, immunoactive and toxic peptides larger than 33-mer, which is a POP inhibitor.",

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of CD in clinically suspicious celiac disease patients and in patients with disorders known to be associated with CD, such as autoimmune diseases, using serological assay for IgA-endomysial antibodies (EMA) on inexpensive human tissue substrate. IgA-endomysial and IgA-reticulin antibodies (ARA) were evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) study using human umbilical cord (HUC) and rat tissues, respectively, in the following groups: group 1, 145 patients with clinical suspicion of CD; group 2, 80 with autoimmune diseases; group 3, 20 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); and group 4, 100 healthy blood donors. Of the 145 patients with suspected CD (group 1), 11 were EMA positive with or without ARA, giving a serological prevalence of 7.6%. The histological findings of intestinal biopsy were confirmed in six of them, indicating a CD prevalence of 4%. In group 2, two EMA-positive (2.5%) with or without ARA cases were found. Both were from the 18 patients who had autoimmune thyroid disease, indicating an 11% prevalence of EMA in autoimmune thyroid disease. No positive EMA was detected in the 3rd and 4th groups, indicating 100% specificity. Our findings showed high prevalence of CD in a reference laboratory setting. This highlights the importance of keeping CD in mind and of promptly investigating suspected individuals. There is also a high prevalence of CD among patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases, and further studies are needed to elucidate the significance of this association. Test for endomysial antibodies using human umbilical cord is an inexpensive, easily available and highly specific tool for identifying patients to undergo biopsy and to screen at-risk groups of patients.",

IgG and IgA transglutaminase and gliadin were measured with ELISA. IgA AE were tested by indirect immunofluorescence using 2 substrates; monkey oesophagus and human umbilical cord. AR were detected by indirect immunofluorescence on rat liver, kidney and stomach. Sera IgA level was measured by turbidimetry. 83/261 of diabetics were positive for at least one antibody, 5.7% had ATGt-A, 3.4% AE on monkey esophagus, 3.1% AE on umbilical cordon, 18% AGD-A, 19.5% AGD-G and 3.1% AR. There was an excellent concordance between AE and ATGt (r = 0.9). Out of the 261 diabetics, 5 had an IgA deficiency and one of them has IgG AE and ATGt. serological markers of celiac disease seem to be frequent in diabetics. Nevertheless, diagnosis must be confirmed by histological studies which allow us to know the real prevalence of celiac disease in diabetic adults.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac Sprue is a multifactorial disease characterized by an intestinal inflammatory response to ingested gluten. Proteolytically resistant gluten peptides from wheat, rye, and barley persist in the intestinal lumen and elicit an immune response in genetically susceptible individuals. Here, we demonstrate the in vivo ability of a gluten-digesting protease (\"glutenase\") to accelerate the breakdown of a gluten-rich solid meal. The proenzyme form of endoprotease B, isoform 2 from Hordeum vulgare (EP-B2), was orally administered to adult rats with a solid meal containing 1 g of gluten. Gluten digestion in the stomach and small intestine was monitored as a function of enzyme dose and time by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. In the absence of supplementary EP-B2, gluten was solubilized and proteolyzed to a limited extent in the stomach and was hydrolyzed and assimilated mostly in the small intestine. In contrast, EP-B2 was remarkably effective at digesting gluten in the rat stomach in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. At a 1:25 EP-B2/gluten dose, the gastric concentration of the highly immunogenic 33-mer gliadin peptide was reduced by more than 50-fold within 90 min with no overt signs of toxicity. Evaluation of EP-B2 as an adjunct to diet control is therefore warranted in celiac patients.",

We studied 78 consecutive untreated AIH-1 patients and 160 controls: 22 with autoimmune hepatitis type 2 (AIH-2), 51 with hepatitis C, 17 with coeliac disease (CD), 20 with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and 50 blood donors. SMA was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on frozen sections of rat tissues, and A-FAA with a modified commercial ELISA. SMA was detected by IIF in 61 (78%) of 78 AIH-1 patients, of whom 47 (60%) had the SMA-T/G and 14 (18%) the SMA-V pattern. Of the pathological controls, 32 (20%) had the SMA-V pattern (25 with hepatitis C, 2 with AIH-2, 2 with PBC, 3 with CD). A-FAA were present in 55 AIH-1 patients (70.5%; 46 with SMA-T/G, 7 with SMA-V, and 2 SMA-negative), and in 10 controls (6%), of whom five had hepatitis C, two AIH-2, two PBC and one CD. The association between A-FAA and the SMA-T/G pattern was statistically significant (p<0.0001). A-FAA levels were higher in SMA-T/G positive than SMA-V positive AIH-1 patients and controls (p<0.0001). A-FAA positivity was significantly associated with higher gamma-globulin and IgG levels, but did not correlate with other considered parameters. The modified A-FAA ELISA strictly correlates with the SMA-T/G pattern and is a reliable and operator independent assay for AIH-1. Detection of A-FAA, even if devoid of prognostic relevance, may be useful when interpretative doubts of standard IIF arise.",

Lower abundance is found in children and in elderly individuals. The species is evolutionary adapted to fermenting plant-derived glycans and is equipped with an extensive sugar transporter and degradation enzymes repertoire. Consequently, the species is strongly affected by dietary carbohydrates and is able to utilize a wide range of prebiotic molecules. B. adolescentis is specialized in metabolizing resistant starch and is considered a primary starch degrader enabling growth of other beneficial bacteria by cross-feeding. The major metabolic output is acetate and lactate in a ratio of 3:2. Several health-beneficial properties have been demonstrated in certain strains of B. adolescentis in vitro and in rodent models, including enhancement of the intestinal barrier function, anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory effects, and the production of neurotransmitters (GABA), and vitamins. Although causalities have not been established, reduced abundance of B. adolescentis as part of a dysbiotic colonic microbiota in human observational studies has been associated with inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, coeliac disease, cystic fibrosis, Helicobacter pylori infection, type 1 and 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and certain allergies. It is therefore reasonable to conceive B. adolescentis as a health-associated, or even health-promoting bacterial species in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease is a highly prevalent immune-mediated enteropathy that develops in genetically susceptible individuals expressing HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 after ingestion of gluten and results in decreased quality of life and increased morbidity. This pathology is triggered by immunogenic peptides generated from gliadins present in gluten, which act on the intestinal mucosa in a context of high intestinal permeability, activating the innate and adaptive response of the immune system. Several in vivo rodent models attempt to reproduce some phases of the intestinal inflammatory process that occurs in celiac disease. Allergic sensitization to gluten simulates, or enhances in some animal models, the loss of tolerance to gliadin peptides and the initial events that lead to celiac disease in a specific genetic or environmental context. Here we describe a simple method for performing gliadin sensitization in an in vivo animal model.",

LA is currently being studied in phase III clinical trials and is orally administered to adult patients with celiac disease as an adjunct therapeutic to enhance intestinal barrier function that has been disrupted by gliadin-induced immune reactivity. Mechanistically, LA is thought to act as a zonulin antagonist to reduce zonulin-induced increases in barrier permeability and has been associated with the redistribution and rearrangement of tight junction proteins and actin filaments to restore intestinal barrier function. More recently, LA has been linked to inhibition of myosin light chain kinase, which likely reduces tension on actin filaments, thereby facilitating tight junction closure. Small (rodent) and large (porcine) animal studies have been conducted that demonstrate the importance of LA as a tight junction regulatory peptide in conditions other than celiac disease, including collagen-induced arthritis in mice and intestinal ischemic injury in pigs.",

These include: Celiac Disease (CeD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Sjogren's Syndrome (SS), and Type 1 diabetes (T1D). All of these have intestinal microbiomes that are different from healthy controls. There have been numerous studies using animal models of single probiotics (monoclonal) or mixtures of probiotics (polyclonal) and even complete microbiota transfer (fecal microbial transfer-FMT) to inhibit or delay the onset of autoimmune diseases such as the aforementioned common ones. However, proportionally, fewer clinical trials have utilized monoclonal therapies or FMT than polyclonal therapies for treating autoimmune diseases, even though bacterial mono-therapies do inhibit the development of autoimmune diseases and/or delay the onset of autoimmune diseases in rodent models of those autoimmune diseases. In this review then, we review the previously completed and currently ongoing clinical trials that are testing bacterial therapies (FMT, monoclonal, and polyclonal) to treat common autoimmune dseases and discuss the successes in using bacterial monotherapies to treat rodent models of these common autoimmune diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Gliadin, a component of wheat gluten known to be an important factor in the etiology of celiac disease, is related to several other diseases through its enhancing effect on intestinal paracellular permeability. We investigated the significance of gliadin in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced small-intestinal damage in mice. 7-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were divided into the following groups: standard diet group, in which mice were fed with wheat-containing standard rodent diet (CE-2); gluten-free diet group, in which mice were fed with gluten-free diet (AIN-76A); and gliadin-administered group, in which mice fed with gluten-free diet were administered with gliadin (~250 mg/kg BW). Each group was subdivided into negative, healthy control group and NSAID-treated group. To some mice fed with gluten-free diet and administered with gliadin, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor was administered for clarification of the significance of EGFR in NSAID-induced small intestinal damage and intestinal permeability. In mice fed with a gluten-free diet, indomethacin or diclofenac induced very mild mucosal damage in the small intestine compared with that in mice fed with a wheat-containing standard diet. Gliadin exacerbated the NSAID-induced small-intestinal damage in mice fed with a gluten-free diet. With the administration of indomethacin, MPO activity, a marker of neutrophil infiltration into the mucosa and mRNA expression level of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 in the small intestine were higher in the gliadin-administered mice. Gliadin increased the intestinal paracellular permeability without indomethacin administration (4.3-fold) and further increased the permeability after indomethacin administration (2.1-fold). Gliadin induced phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in small-intestinal tissues, and erlotinib (an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor) attenuated the indomethacin-induced intestinal damage and permeability exacerbated by gliadin, accompanied by inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation. These results suggest that gliadin plays an important role in the induction and exacerbation of NSAID-induced small-intestinal damage, and that increase in intestinal permeability via the EGFR signalling pathway is involved in its mechanism.",

        "Title": "Hookworm Secreted Extracellular Vesicles Interact With Host Cells and Prevent Inducible Colitis in Mice.",
        "Abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) parasites, hookworms in particular, have evolved to cause minimal harm to their hosts, allowing them to establish chronic infections. This is mediated by creating an immunoregulatory environment. Indeed, hookworms are such potent suppressors of inflammation that they have been used in clinical trials to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and celiac disease. Since the recent description of helminths (worms) secreting extracellular vesicles (EVs), exosome-like EVs from different helminths have been characterized and their salient roles in parasite-host interactions have been highlighted. Here, we analyze EVs from the rodent parasite <i>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</i>, which has been used as a model for human hookworm infection. <i>N. brasiliensis</i> EVs (<i>Nb</i>-EVs) are actively internalized by mouse gut organoids, indicating a role in driving parasitism. We used proteomics and RNA-Seq to profile the molecular composition of <i>Nb</i>-EVs. We identified 81 proteins, including proteins frequently present in exosomes (like tetraspanin, enolase, 14-3-3 protein, and heat shock proteins), and 27 sperm-coating protein-like extracellular proteins. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 52 miRNA species, many of which putatively map to mouse genes involved in regulation of inflammation. To determine whether GI nematode EVs had immunomodulatory properties, we assessed their potential to suppress GI inflammation in a mouse model of inducible chemical colitis. EVs from <i>N. brasiliensis</i> but not those from the whipworm <i>Trichuris muris</i> or control vesicles from grapes protected against colitic inflammation in the gut of mice that received a single intraperitoneal injection of EVs. Key cytokines associated with colitic pathology (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IFN\u03b3, and IL-17a) were significantly suppressed in colon tissues from EV-treated mice. By contrast, high levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were detected in <i>Nb</i>-EV-treated mice. Proteins and miRNAs contained within helminth EVs hold great potential application in development of drugs to treat helminth infections as well as chronic non-infectious diseases resulting from a dysregulated immune system, such as IBD.",

        "Abstract": "In an earlier study, infection of human pancreatic islets with epidemic strains of echovirus (E4, E16, E30), with proven but differently ability to induce islet autoimmunity, resulted either in a severe damage (i.e., E16 and E30) or proceeded without visible changes in infected islets (i.e., E4). In this study, the ability of these strains to replicate in beta cells and the consequence of such an infection for beta cell lysis and beta cell function was studied in the pancreatic beta cell lines INS-1, MIN6, and NIT-1. The strains of E16 and E30 did replicate in INS1, MIN6, and NIT1 cells and resulted in a pronounced cytopathic effect within 3 days following infection. By contrast, E4 replicated in all examined insulinoma cells with no apparent cell destruction. The insulin release in response to high glucose stimulation was hampered in all infected cells (P < 0.05) when no evidence of cytolysis was present; however, the adverse effect of E16 and E30 on insulin secretion appeared to be higher than that of the E4 strain. The differential effects of echovirus infection on cell lysis, and beta cell function in the rodent insulinoma INS1, MIN6, and NIT 1 cells reflect those previously obtained in primary human islets and support the notion that the insulin-producing beta cells can harbor a non-cytopathic viral infection.",

A common genetic OGG1 variant may affect the activity and was associated with increased levels of oxidized purines in leukocytes without apparent effect on 8-oxoGua excretion or major change in cancer risk. 8-OxoGua excretion has been associated with exposure to air pollution, toxic metals, tobacco smoke and low plasma antioxidant levels, whereas fruit and vegetable intake or dietary interventions showed no association. In rodent studies some types of feed may be source of 8-oxoGua in collected urine. Of cancer therapies, cisplatin increased 8-oxoGua excretion, whereas radiotherapy only showed such effects in experimental animals. Case-control studies found high excretion of 8-oxoGua in relation to cancer, dementia and celiac disease but not hemochromatosis, although associations could be a consequence rather than reflecting causality of disease. One prospective study found increased risk of developing lung cancer among non-smokers associated with high excretion of 8-oxoGua. Urinary excretion of 8-oxoGua is a promising biomarker of oxidatively damaged DNA.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetic autonomic neuropathy is a debilitating, poorly studied complication of diabetes. Our previous studies of non-obese diabetic (NOD) and related mouse models identified rapidly developing, dramatic pathology in prevertebral sympathetic ganglia; however, once diabetic, the mice did not survive for extended periods needed to examine the ability of therapeutic agents to correct established neuropathy. In the current manuscript we show that the Akita (Ins2(Akita)) mouse is a robust model of diabetic sympathetic autonomic neuropathy with unambiguous, spontaneous, rapidly-developing neuropathology which corresponds closely to the characteristic pathology of other rodent models and man. Akita mice diabetic for 2, 4 or 8 months of diabetes progressively developed markedly swollen axons and dendrites (\"neuritic dystrophy\") in the prevertebral superior mesenteric (SMG) and celiac ganglia (CG). Comparable changes failed to develop in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) of the Akita mouse or in any ganglia of non-diabetic mice. Morphometric studies demonstrate an overall increase in presynaptic axon terminal cross sectional area, including those without any ultrastructural features of dystrophy. Neurons in Akita mouse prevertebral sympathetic ganglia show an unusual perikaryal alteration characterized by the accumulation of membranous aggregates and minute mitochondria and loss of rough endoplasmic reticulum. These changes result in the loss of a third of neurons in the CG over the course of 8 months of diabetes. The extended survival of diabetic mice and robust pathologic findings provide a clinically relevant paradigm that will facilitate the analysis of novel therapeutic agents on the reversal of autonomic neuropathy.",

        "Abstract": "Lipids have been implicated in beta-cell stimulus-secretion coupling. In such a role, lipases in beta-cells would be required to generate lipid coupling factors. We have shown previously that glucose stimulates lipolysis in rodent islets. In addition, lipolysis and diacylglycerol lipase activity in islets are abolished by orlistat, an irreversible lipase inhibitor with a broad specificity for substrates. Moreover, orlistat dose-dependently inhibits glucose- and forskolin-stimulated insulin secretion, while leaving glucose oxidation and the rise in the ATP/ADP ratio intact. In an effort to identify beta-cell lipase(s), we found that HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase), the rate-limiting enzyme for acylglycerol hydrolysis in adipocytes, is expressed in rodent beta-cells. To resolve the role of this lipase, we have created global and beta-cell-specific knockout mice. Although our line of global HSL-knockout mice is moderately glucose-intolerant owing to reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity and exhibits normal islet metabolism and insulin secretion, other HSL-knockout lines have displayed impaired insulin secretion under certain conditions. In contrast, beta-cell-specific HSL-knockout mice, which are less prone to genetic redundancy, are hyperglycaemic, presumably caused by a perturbation of first-phase insulin secretion. Thus studies by us and others demonstrate that lipases, such as HSL, play a regulatory role in beta-cell stimulus-secretion coupling.",

This study sought to determine whether pharmacological inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis in the intestine attenuates pathophysiological sequelae of shock induced by splanchnic artery occlusion and reperfusion. Ischemia and reperfusion injury was induced in anesthetized rats by clamping both the superior mesenteric artery and the celiac artery for 45 min followed by reperfusion. Within 6 min after reperfusion, animals developed significant systemic hypotension with 100% of the animals dying during the 4-h period of reperfusion. In parallel experiments, animals were necropsied after 60 min of reperfusion, and the ileum was harvested for histological examination and assessment of biochemical changes. Administration of fumonisin B1 (FB1), a competitive and reversible inhibitor of ceramide synthase (3 mg/kg, 15 min before reperfusion), significantly reduced i) the increased ceramide expression as detected by immunohistochemistry; ii) peroxynitrite-mediated protein nitration; iii) infiltration of the reperfused intestine with polymorphonuclear neutrophils following a decrease in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression; iv) production of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha; and v) apoptosis in the ileum. Overall, tissue-protective effects were clearly observed upon histological examination of the ileum. These beneficial events were ultimately linked to decreases in both the development of hypotension and overall mortality. These results implicate ceramide as a key signaling molecule in splanchnic arterial ischemia and reperfusion-induced shock. The broader implications of our results provide a pharmacological rationale for the development of inhibitors of ceramide biosynthesis as novel therapeutics for ischemia and reperfusion-induced shock of several etiologies.",

        "Abstract": "Smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) with anti-F-actin specificity are commonly regarded as specific markers of type 1 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH-1) but, at the moment, a gold standard method for their identification is not available. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy for AIH-1 of three new methods of detecting anti-F-actin antibodies, and to compare the results with those obtained using the indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) method on rodent tissue. The sera of 33 AIH-1 patients and 104 controls (eight with type 2 AIH, 30 with chronic hepatitis C, 16 with celiac disease, 40 with primary biliary cirrhosis, and 10 with liver steatosis) were assayed for anti-F-actin antibodies using four methods: two IIF methods (one on rat tissue sections and the other on VSM 47 cell line derived from the thoracic aorta of rat embryo), an ELISA method and an Immunodot (ID) method. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were, respectively, 51.5, 95.2, 77.3 and 86.1% for IIF on the VSM 47 cell line; 63.6, 86.5, 60 and 88.2% for the ELISA method; 72.7, 82.7, 57.1 and 90.5% for the ID assay; and 57.6, 96.1, 82.6 and 87.7% for the IIF on rat tissue sections. The methods used for anti-F-actin antibody detection have different diagnostic performances. Both IIF methods, the one on rat tissues and the other on VSM47 cell line, are highly specific for AIH-1. In contrast, ELISA and especially ID show positive results in control population, although usually at low levels (with the single exception of PBC patients). Therefore, having a high positive predictive value, both IIF methods are reliable tools for the specific detection of AIH-associated anti-F-actin autoantibodies, whereas the immunometric assays might be integrated into the diagnostic scheme as second level tests upon improvement of their respective cut-offs to confirm anti-F-actin positivity in case of SMA positivity.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease is an autoimmune illness characterized by intestinal mucosal injury and malabsorption precipitated by dietary exposure to gluten of some cereals. The immune response is based on both cellular and humoral components, although the former seem to be more important in the pathogenesis. The autoantibody response is directed at the enzyme tissue transglutaminase, tTG or TG2, which possibly play a role in the onset of the disease. In this study we sought to develop an animal model in which to analyze the immunological regulation and significance of anti-TG2 antibodies, by expressing specific human single-chain antibody fragments in mice using adeno-associated virus vectors. Upon vector injection in the skeletal muscles, high and persistent systemic levels of anti-TG2 antibodies were obtained. Mice injected with vectors encoding antibodies also recognizing rodent TG2, also developed a strong anti-idiotypic response. This finding raises the question of whether an anti-idiotypic response to anti-TG2 antibodies is a factor associated with celiac disease.",

        "Abstract": "To address the pathogenesis of diabetic autonomic neuropathy, we have examined the sympathetic nervous system in non-obese diabetic (NOD) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice, two models of type 1 diabetes, and the db/db mouse, a model of type 2 diabetes. After only 3 to 5 weeks of diabetes, NOD mice developed markedly swollen axons and dendrites (\"neuritic dystrophy\") in the prevertebral superior mesenteric and celiac ganglia (SMG-CG), similar to the pathology described in diabetic STZ- and BBW-rat and man. Comparable changes failed to develop in the superior cervical ganglia of the NOD mouse or in the SMG-CG of non-diabetic NOD siblings. STZ-induced diabetic mice develop identical changes, although at a much slower pace and to a lesser degree than NOD mice. NOD-SCID mice, which are genetically identical to NOD mice except for the absence of T and B cells, do not develop diabetes or neuropathology comparable to diabetic NOD mice. However, STZ-treated NOD-SCID mice develop severe neuritic dystrophy, evidence against an exclusively autoimmune pathogenesis for autonomic neuropathy in this model. Chronically diabetic type 2 db/db mice fail to develop neuritic dystrophy, suggesting that hyperglycemia alone may not be the critical and sufficient element. The NOD mouse appears to be a valuable model of diabetic sympathetic autonomic neuropathy with unambiguous, rapidly developing neuropathology which corresponds closely to the characteristic pathology of other rodent models and man.",

This study was undertaken to investigate whether the tissue distribution of transglutaminase is also compatible with reticulin, jejunal, and fibroblast autoantibody binding patterns. Sera from patients with and without celiac disease, monoclonal tissue transglutaminase antibodies, and sera from mice parenterally immunized against commercially available tissue transglutaminase, transglutaminase complexed with gliadin, or gliadin were used in indirect immunofluorescence and double-staining studies using both rodent and primate tissues as substrates. Also, antibody competition, affinity chromatography, and potassium thiocyanate extraction studies were undertaken. Tissue transglutaminase antibody binding patterns were identical with the extracellular binding patterns seen with celiac patient sera. Human umbilical cord-derived fibroblasts exhibited both cytoplasmic and extracellular matrix staining. Double staining with patients' sera and tissue transglutaminase antibodies showed complete overlapping. Tissue transglutaminase effectively absorbed reticulin-endomysial antibodies from celiac sera, and patients' sera blocked the staining of the monoclonal tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Potassium thiocyanate extraction abolished the staining patterns, but they were elicited again after readdition of tissue transglutaminase. Reticulin, endomysial, and jejunal antibodies detect transglutaminase in both rodent and primate tissues, indicating that these tissue autoantibodies are identical.",

AEA were detected on HUC and primate oesophagus in a blind study, using sera from 46 patients with untreated coeliac disease and 108 controls. Tissue adsorption studies were performed using homogenized tissue from rodent liver, HUC, primate oesophagus and human liver. Sera were adsorbed with each of these homogenates and antibody was detected using HUC, primate oesophagus and rat kidney. In the inhibition experiments AEA was detected on HUC, and inhibition of binding was attempted by pre-incubating the sections with antibodies against collagen types I, III and IV. The sensitivity of AEA was 91% when detected on HUC, 89% when detected on primate oesophagus (93% and 91%, respectively, after exclusion of 1 patient with IgA deficiency). Specificity was 100% for both assays. Tissue adsorption studies showed identical results for AEA detected on both HUC or primate oesophagus, whereas antireticulin antibody was adsorbed only by rodent tissue. Blocking of the HUC with anticollagen antibodies did not prevent binding of AEA. HUC is an effective substrate for the detection of AEA and may be superior to primate oesophagus. The antibody detected by HUC shows identical tissue adsorption specificities to that detected on primate oesophagus.",

Thirty-three patients (4.1%) were positive for at least one of the two antibodies; IgA HUC-EmA were found in 25 patients, whereas IgA and IgG AGA were detected in 19 and 24 subjects, respectively. Twenty-seven (82%) of the 33 patients with immunological markers showed sub-total or severe partial villous atrophy consistent with celiac sprue, whereas the remaining six cases had normal histological findings. None of 30 antibody-negative biopsied patients showed abnormalities of duodenal mucosa. Of the 27 newly diagnosed celiacs, only 21 (78%) were positive for IgA and/or IgG AGA, whereas IgA HUC-EmA were found in all but two cases (93%). In these two cases, positive only for IgG AGA, celiac sprue was associated with IgA deficiency.

        "Abstract": "Intestinal inflammation seems invariably to be associated with increased epithelial proliferation. In the small bowel the pathological consequences of this area an increase in the crypt proliferative compartment and a decrease in the absorptive villus compartment, which can lead to malabsorption. In the colon, it is more difficult to examine changes in cell proliferation, but using Ki67, epithelial proliferation has been shown to be increased in ulcerative colitis and parasitic infection. The teleological advantage of increasing epithelial proliferation during intestinal inflammation is presumably in an effort to get rid of parasitized or infected epithelial cells, or to rapidly replace cells which have been lost. Rejection of helminth parasites from rodent small bowel is associated with partial villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy, which is probably part of the host response making the mucosa inhospitable to the parasites. The short-term nutritional disadvantage of malabsorption is outweighed by the long-term advantage of being parasite-free. However, when the intestinal inflammation is elicited by a dietary constituent, the consequences are only pathological. At the moment there is no information as to the mechanisms by which inflammatory cells alter mucosal morphology and epithelial renewal. The restructuring of mucosal morphology in the flat-mucosa involves considerable adaptation of the connective tissue elements of the lamina propria. Whether this occurs in response to changes in epithelial renewal is not known. Finally, it is clear that activated T cells in the lamina propria can produce a flat-mucosa. In diseases such as Trichuris dysentery and ulcerative colitis there is no or very little T cell activation, even though epithelial proliferation is increased. Increased epithelial proliferation therefore may occur in response to different inflammatory stimuli.",

Because both types of antibodies occur in both forms of gluten-sensitive enteropathy, studies were conducted to determine if the two types of antibodies can be distinguished by species and organ specificity. The results of these studies indicate that distinct endomysium-specific and reticulin-specific antibodies can be found and that these differ in their species specificity; i.e., endomysium antigen occurs in primate and not in rodent tissues while the reticulin antigen occurs in rodent and not in primate tissues. However, the activity of both endomysium and reticulin antibodies demonstrates similar tissue distribution, in that both react to antigens associated with gastrointestinal smooth muscles, peritubular and periglomerular areas of the kidney, and sinusoidal and periportal areas of the liver. Also, both antigens seem to be present in sheep and goat tissue.

Similar high antibody frequencies were detected in 32 untreated adults (91%) and 18 children (100%) with coeliac disease and in 14 dermatitis herpetiformis patients with subtotal villous atrophy (reticulin antibodies 93% and endomysium antibodies 100%). The specificity of IgA class reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies was high because all 45 adult patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, 24 non-coeliac children with abdominal symptoms and 99/100 healthy blood donors were negative for these antibodies. The only positive blood donor had both IgA class reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies but also she was found to have coeliac disease. IgA class reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies declined in parallel during treatment with a gluten free diet and increased on gluten challenge. This suggests that these antibodies can be used to screen for gluten sensitive enteropathy and to monitor dietary treatment. To characterise the tissue specificity of reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies four positive sera were absorbed with human and several rodent liver homogenates. Absorption with rat or other rodent livers removed the rodent-specific reticulin antibodies but not the reticulin antibodies detectable with human tissues or the endomysium antibodies detectable with monkey oesophagus. These results show that reticulin antibodies can be divided into the rat and human subtypes. The human subtype could not be separated from endomysium antibodies in the present absorption experiments.",

An altered intestinal immunity is associated with changes to the gut microbiota, barrier function, and tolerance to luminal antigens. Lipid metabolism and its unbalance can also contribute to acute and chronic inflammation in different conditions. In celiac disease (CD), the serum phospholipid profile in infants who developed CD is dramatically different when compared to that of infants at risk of CD not developing the disease. In a mouse model of gluten sensitivity, oral wheat gliadin challenge in connection with inhibition of the metabolism of arachidonic acid, an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, specifically induces the enteropathy. Recent evidence suggests that gluten may play a role also for development of life-style related diseases in populations on a high fat diet (HFD). However, the mechanisms behind these effects are not yet understood. Exploratory studies in mice feed HFD show that wheat gliadin consumption affects glucose and lipid metabolic homeostasis, alters the gut microbiota, and the immune cell profile in liver.",

NOD.DQ8 mice genetically predisposed to CeD were subjected to a diet regime and oral gavage to induce the disease (gluten group vs. control). We tested vascular function, confirmed disease indicators, and evaluated inflammation and oxidative stress in various tissues. Plasma proteome profiling was also performed. CeD markers were confirmed in the gluten group, indicating increased blood pressure and impaired vascular relaxation. Pro-inflammatory genes were upregulated in this group, with increased CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cell infiltration and oxidative stress parameters observed in aortic and heart tissue. However, heart function remained unaffected. Plasma proteomics suggested the cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A) as a link between gut and vascular inflammation. Cardiovascular complications were reversed by adopting a gluten-free diet. Our study sheds light in the heightened cardiovascular risk associated with active CeD, revealing a gut-to-cardiovascular inflammatory axis potentially mediated by immune cell infiltration and IL-17A. These findings augment our understanding of the link between CeD and cardiovascular disease providing clinically relevant insight into the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, our discovery that cardiovascular complications can be reversed by a gluten-free diet underscores a critical role for dietary interventions in mitigating cardiovascular risks associated with CeD.",

        "Abstract": "In human celiac disease (CeD) HLA-DQ2.5 presents gluten peptides to antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, thereby instigating immune activation and enteropathy. Targeting HLA-DQ2.5 with neutralizing antibody for treating CeD may be plausible, yet using pan-HLA-DQ antibody risks affecting systemic immunity, while targeting selected gluten peptide:HLA-DQ2.5 complex (pHLA-DQ2.5) may be insufficient. Here we generate a TCR-like, neutralizing antibody (DONQ52) that broadly recognizes more than twenty-five distinct gluten pHLA-DQ2.5 through rabbit immunization with multi-epitope gluten pHLA-DQ2.5 and multidimensional optimization. Structural analyses show that the proline-rich and glutamine-rich motif of gluten epitopes critical for pathogenesis is flexibly recognized by multiple tyrosine residues present in the antibody paratope, implicating the mechanisms for the broad reactivity. In HLA-DQ2.5 transgenic mice, DONQ52 demonstrates favorable pharmacokinetics with high subcutaneous bioavailability, and blocks immunity to gluten while not affecting systemic immunity. Our results thus provide a rationale for clinical testing of DONQ52 in CeD.",

        "Title": "A role for pathogenic autoantibodies in small fiber neuropathy?",
        "Abstract": "The immune system has a role in neuropathic pain which includes autoimmune mechanisms (e.g., autoantibodies). Clinical studies have identified a number of conditions where neuropathic pain is common and that are associated with autoantibodies targeting antigens within the nervous system. Interestingly sensory symptoms can be relieved with immunotherapies or plasma exchange, suggesting that pain in these patients is antibody-mediated. Recent preclinical studies have directly addressed this. For example, passive transfer of CASPR2 autoantibodies from patients cause increased pain sensitivity and enhanced sensory neuron excitability in mice confirming pathogenicity and demonstrating that patient autoantibodies are a mechanism to cause neuropathic pain. Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) exclusively affects small sensory fibers (typically nociceptors) and is characterized by severe neuropathic pain. Known causes include diabetes, B12 deficiency and rare variants in sodium channel genes, although around 50% of cases are idiopathic. SFN is associated with autoimmune conditions such as Sjorgen's syndrome, Sarcoidosis and Celiac disease and immunotherapy in the form of Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has proved an effective treatment. Autoantibodies have been identified and, in some cases, passive transfer of SFN patient IgG in mice can recapitulate neuropathic pain-like behavior. Here we will discuss clinical and preclinical data relating to the idea that pathogenic autoantibodies contribute to SNF. We discuss putative pathogenic antibodies, cellular targets and the molecular mechanisms by which they cause sensory neuron damage and the development of neuropathic pain. Finally, we will comment on future directions which may provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying SFN in patients.",

        "Abstract": "Paneth cells (PCs), a specialized secretory cell type in the small intestine, are increasingly recognized as having an essential role in host responses to microbiome and environmental stresses. Whether and how commensal and pathogenic microbes modify PC composition to modulate inflammation remain unclear. Using newly developed PC-reporter mice under conventional and gnotobiotic conditions, we determined PC transcriptomic heterogeneity in response to commensal and invasive microbes at single cell level. Infection expands the pool of CD74<sup>+</sup> PCs, whose number correlates with auto or allogeneic inflammatory disease progressions in mice. Similar correlation was found in human inflammatory disease tissues. Infection-stimulated cytokines increase production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of a PC-specific mucosal pentraxin (Mptx2) in activated PCs. A PC-specific ablation of MyD88 reduced CD74<sup>+</sup> PC population, thus ameliorating pathogen-induced systemic disease. A similar phenotype was also observed in mice lacking Mptx2. Thus, infection stimulates expansion of a PC subset that influences disease progression.",

Herein, we describe two in vivo approaches in HLA-DQ8-transgenic mice to study the intrinsic cytoxicity and immune features of wheat gliadin. By adopting the first method, we explored the mucosal architecture of the small intestine following the intra-gastric administration of wheat gliadin in mice treated with indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenases. Mice showed a significant reduction of villus height, increased crypt depth and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. The second approach involved the mucosal sensitization to gliadin via the intranasal route. This protocol induced a Th1/Th17 phenotype in mesenteric lymph nodes, as described in CD. In conclusion, these methods remain instrumental to analyze in vivo distinct biological features of wheat gliadin and related prolamins. Furthermore, the sensitization protocol could be exploited to test innovative strategies downregulating the gliadin-specific immunity.",

        "Abstract": "Prolyl endopeptidases from Sphingomonas capsulata (SC PEP) has attracted much attention as promising oral therapy candidate for celiac sprue, however, its low stability in the gastric environment leads to unsatisfactory clinical results. Therefore, improving its stability against pepsin digestion at low pH is crucial for clinical applications, but challenging. In this study, machine learning and physical parameter model were combined to design SC PEP mutants. After iterations, 20 mutants had higher hydrolysis activity in stomach environment, which was up to 14.1-fold compared with wild-type SC PEP. Mutant M24 involving stable and active mutations and pegylated M24 (M24-PEG) had higher activity of hydrolyzing immunogen in bread than wild-type SC PEP in vitro and in vivo, and residual immunogens in simulated gastric environment were only 1/8 and 1/10 of that in the wild-type SC PEP group. The total residual immunogens in the gastrointestinal tract of mice in the M24 and M24-PEG groups were <20\u00a0ppm, reaching the standard of non-toxic food. Our results indicate that the combination of M24 (or M24-PEG) with EP-B2 may be a promising candidate for celiac disease, and the strategies developed in this study provide a paradigm for the design of SC PEP stability mutants.",

In mice, dietary wheat amylase-trypsin inhibitors (ATIs) activate intestinal myeloid cells and augment T cell-mediated systemic inflammation. The aim of this study was to assess whether a wheat- and thus ATI-reduced diet might exert beneficial effects in RRMS patients with modest disease activity. In this 6-month, crossover, open-label, bicentric proof-of-concept trial, 16 RRMS patients with stable disease course were randomized to either 3\u2009months of a standard wheat-containing diet with consecutive switch to a\u2009>\u200990% wheat-reduced diet, or vice versa. The primary endpoint was negative, as the frequency of circulating pro-inflammatory T cells did not decrease during the ATI-reduced diet. We did, however, observe decreased frequencies of CD14<sup>+</sup> CD16<sup>++</sup> monocytes and a concomitant increase in CD14<sup>++</sup> CD16<sup>-</sup> monocytes during the wheat-reduced diet interval. This was accompanied by an improvement in pain-related quality of life in health-related quality of life assessed (SF-36). Our results suggest that the wheat- and thus ATI-reduced diet was associated with changes in monocyte subsets and improved pain-related quality of life in RRMS patients.

        "Abstract": "Gluten accumulation damages the proximal small intestine and causes celiac disease (CeD) which has not been effectively treated except by using a gluten-free diet. In this study, strain Bacillus subtilis LZU-GM was isolated from Pakistani traditional fermented sourdough and could degrade 73.7% of gluten in 24\u00a0h in vitro. Strain LZU-GM was employed for practical application to investigate gluten degradation in mice models. The results showed that strain LZU-GM was colonized in mice and the survival rate was around 0.95 % (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The gluten degradation was 3-fold higher in the small intestine of the strain LZU-GM treated mice group remaining 1511.96\u00a0ng/mL of gluten peptides than the untreated mice group (6500.38\u00a0ng/mL). Immunochemical analysis showed that gluten-treated mice established positive antigliadin antibodies (AGA) in serum (IgA, IgG, and anti-TG2 antibodies) as compared to the strain LZU-GM treatment group. Furthermore, the number of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, and COX-2 cells decrease in the lamina propria of the strain LZU-GM treatment group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Microbial community bar plot analysis showed that Lactobacillus, Dubosiella, and Enterococcus genera were restored and stabilized in the LZU-GM treatment group while Blautia and Ruminococcus were found lower. The oral gavage of probiotic strain LZU-GM might be useful for gluten metabolism in the intestine during digestion and would be a long-term dietary treatment for CeD management.",

        "Abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and celiac disease are prevalent intestinal inflammatory disorders with nonsatisfactory therapeutic interventions. Analyzing patient data-driven cohorts can highlight disease pathways and new targets for interventions. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are attractive candidates, since they are readily targetable by RNA therapeutics, show relative cell-specific expression, and play key cellular functions. Uniformly analyzing gut mucosal transcriptomics from 696 subjects, we have highlighted lncRNA expression along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, demonstrating that, in control samples, lncRNAs have a more location-specific expression in comparison with protein-coding genes. We defined dysregulation of lncRNAs in treatment-naive UC, CD, and celiac diseases using independent test and validation cohorts. Using the Predicting Response to Standardized Pediatric Colitis Therapy (PROTECT) inception UC cohort, we defined and prioritized lncRNA linked with UC severity and prospective outcomes, and we highlighted lncRNAs linked with gut microbes previously implicated in mucosal homeostasis. HNF1A-AS1 lncRNA was reduced in all 3 conditions and was further reduced in more severe UC form. Similarly, the reduction of HNF1A-AS1 ortholog in mice gut epithelia showed higher sensitivity to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, which was coupled with alteration in the gut microbial community. These analyses highlight prioritized dysregulated lncRNAs that can guide future preclinical studies for testing them as potential targets.",

        "Abstract": "Type I interferons (IFNs) are highly expressed in the gut mucosa of celiac disease (CD) gut mucosa and stimulates immune response prompted by gluten ingestion, but the processes that maintain the production of these inflammatory molecules are not well understood. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), an RNA-editing enzyme, plays a crucial role in inhibiting self or viral RNAs from activating auto-immune mediated responses, most notably within the type-I IFN production pathway. The aim of this study was to assess whether ADAR1 could contribute to the induction and/or progression of gut inflammation in patients with celiac disease. ADAR1 expression was assessed by Real time PCR and Western blotting in duodenal biopsy taken from inactive and active celiac disease (CD) patients and normal controls (CTR). To analyze the role of ADAR1 in inflamed CD mucosa, lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) were isolated from inactive CD and ADAR1 was silenced in with a specific antisense oligonucleotide (AS) and then incubated with a synthetic analogue of viral dsRNA (poly I:C). IFN-inducing pathways (IRF3, IRF7) in these cells were evaluated with Western blotting and inflammatory cytokines were evaluated with flow cytometry. Lastly, the role of ADAR1 was investigated in a mouse model of poly I:C-driven small intestine atrophy. Reduced ADAR1 expression was seen in duodenal biopsies compared to inactive CD and normal controls. <i>Ex vivo</i> organ cultures of duodenal mucosal biopsies, taken from inactive CD patients, stimulated with a peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin displayed a decreased expression of ADAR1. ADAR1 silencing in LPMC stimulated with a synthetic analogue of viral dsRNA strongly boosted the activation of IRF3 and IRF7 and the production of type-I IFN, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. Administration of ADAR1 antisense but not sense oligonucleotide to mice with poly I:C-induced intestinal atrophy, significantly increased gut damage and inflammatory cytokines production. These data show that ADAR1 is an important regulator of intestinal immune homeostasis and demonstrate that defective ADAR1 expression could provide to amplifying pathogenic responses in CD intestinal mucosa.",

        "Abstract": "Age-related decline in functional elastin is associated with increased arterial stiffness, a known risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease. While the contribution of elastin insufficiency to the stiffening of conduit arteries is well described, little is known about the impact on the structure and function of the resistance vasculature, which contributes to total peripheral resistance and the regulation of organ perfusion. In this study, we determined how elastin insufficiency impinges on age-related changes in the structure and biomechanical properties of the renal microvasculature, altering renal hemodynamics and the response of the renal vascular bed to changes in renal perfusion pressure (RPP) in female mice. Using Doppler ultrasonography, we found that resistive index and pulsatility index were elevated in young <i>Eln</i> <sup>+/-</sup> and aged mice. Histological examination showed thinner internal and external elastic laminae, accompanied by increased elastin fragmentation in the medial layer without any calcium deposits in the small intrarenal arteries of kidneys from young <i>Eln</i> <sup>+/-</sup> and aged mice. Pressure myography of interlobar arteries showed that vessels from young <i>Eln</i> <sup>+/-</sup> and aged mice had a slight decrease in distensibility during pressure loading but a substantial decline in vascular recoil efficiency upon pressure unloading. To examine whether structural changes in the renal microvasculature influenced renal hemodynamics, we clamped neurohumoral input and increased renal perfusion pressure by simultaneously occluding the superior mesenteric and celiac arteries. Increased renal perfusion pressure caused robust changes in blood pressure in all groups; however, changes in renal vascular resistance and renal blood flow (RBF) were blunted in young <i>Eln</i> <sup>+/-</sup> and aged mice, accompanied by decreased autoregulatory index, indicating greater impairment of renal autoregulation. Finally, increased pulse pressure in aged <i>Eln</i> <sup><i>+/-</i></sup> mice positively correlated with high renal blood flow. Together, our data show that the loss of elastin negatively affects the structural and functional integrity of the renal microvasculature, ultimately worsening age-related decline in kidney function.",

To identify receptors conferring reovirus serotype-dependent neuropathogenesis, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPRa screen and identified paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB) as a receptor candidate. Ectopic expression of PirB allowed reovirus binding and infection. PirB extracelluar D3D4 region is required for reovirus attachment and infectivity. Reovirus binds to PirB with nM affinity as determined by single molecule force spectroscopy. Efficient reovirus endocytosis requires PirB signaling motifs. In inoculated mice, PirB is required for maximal replication in the brain and full neuropathogenicity of neurotropic serotype 3 (T3) reovirus. In primary cortical neurons, PirB expression contributes to T3 reovirus infectivity. Thus, PirB is an entry receptor for reovirus and contributes to T3 reovirus replication and pathogenesis in the murine brain.",

We investigated the effects of colonizing adult and neonatal germ-free C57BL/6 mice with CD microbiota, selected based on high (CD-HPA) or low fecal proteolytic activity (CD-LPA), or microbiota from healthy controls with LPA (HC-LPA) or HPA (HC-HPA).

Colonization with HC-LPA or CD-LPA lowered baseline fecal proteolytic activity in germ-free mice, which was paralleled by lower acute inflammatory cell infiltrate.

The research and development of new antibacterial agents for <i>A. baumannii</i> have attracted the attention of the scientific community. Therefore, we have constructed a new pH-responsive antibacterial nano-delivery system (Imi@ZIF-8) for the antibacterial treatment of <i>A. baumannii</i>. Due to its pH-sensitive characteristics, the nano-delivery system offers an improved release of the loaded imipenem antibiotic at the acidic infection site. Based on the high loading capacity and positive charge of the modified ZIF-8 nanoparticles, they are excellent carriers and are suitable for imipenem loading. The Imi@ZIF-8 nanosystem features synergistic antibacterial effects, combining ZIF-8 and imipenem to eliminate <i>A. baumannii</i> through different antibacterial mechanisms. When the loaded imipenem concentration reaches 20\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, Imi@ZIF-8 is highly effective against <i>A. baumannii in vitro</i>. Imi@ZIF-8 not only inhibits the biofilm formation of <i>A. baumannii</i> but also has a potent killing effect. Furthermore, in mice with celiac disease, the Imi@ZIF-8 nanosystem demonstrates excellent therapeutic efficacy against <i>A. baumannii</i> at imipenem concentrations of 10\u00a0mg/kg, and it can inhibit inflammatory reaction and local leukocyte infiltration. Due to its biocompatibility and biosafety, this nano-delivery system is a promising therapeutic strategy in the clinical treatment of <i>A. baumannii</i> infections, providing a new direction for the treatment of antibacterial infections.",

        "Title": "Smad7 as a positive regulator of intestinal inflammatory diseases.",
        "Abstract": "In physiological conditions, the human gut contains more immune cells than the rest of the body, but no overt tissue damage occurs, because several regulatory mechanisms control the activity of such cells thus preventing excessive and detrimental responses. One such mechanism relies on the action of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, a cytokine that targets both epithelial cells and many immune cell types. Loss of TGF-\u03b21 function leads to intestinal pathology in both mice and humans. For instance, disruption of TGF-\u03b21 signaling characterizes the destructive immune-inflammatory response in patients with Crohn's disease and patients with ulcerative colitis, the major human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) entities. In these pathologies, the defective TGF-\u03b21-mediated anti-inflammatory response is associated with elevated intestinal levels of Smad7, an antagonist of TGF-\u03b21 signaling. Consistently, knockdown of Smad7 restores TGF-\u03b21 function thereby attenuating intestinal inflammation in patients with IBD as well as in mice with IBD-like colitis. Up-regulation of Smad7 and reduced TGF-\u03b21 signaling occurs also in necrotizing enterocolitis, environmental enteropathy, refractory celiac disease, and cytomegalovirus-induced colitis. In this article, we review the available data supporting the pathogenic role of Smad7 in the gastrointestinal tract and discuss whether and how targeting Smad7 can help attenuate detrimental immuno-inflammatory responses in the gut.",

        "Title": "Dynamics of the gut microbiome, IgA response, and plasma metabolome in the development of pediatric celiac disease.",
        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten consumption. Almost all CD patients possess human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2/DQ8 haplotypes; however, only a small subset of individuals carrying these alleles develop CD, indicating the role of environmental factors in CD pathogenesis. The main objective of this study was to determine the contributory role of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in CD onset. To this end, we obtained fecal samples from a prospective cohort study (ABIS) at ages 2.5 and 5 years. Samples were collected from children who developed CD after the final sample collection (CD progressors) and healthy children matched by age, HLA genotype, breastfeeding duration, and gluten-exposure time (n=15-16). We first used 16S sequencing and immunoglobulin-A sequencing (IgA-seq) using fecal samples obtained from the same children (i) 16 controls and 15 CD progressors at age 2.5 and (ii) 13 controls and 9 CD progressors at age 5. We completed the cytokine profiling, and plasma metabolomics using plasma samples obtained at age 5 (n=7-9). We also determined the effects of one microbiota-derived metabolite, taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), on the small intestines and immune cell composition in vivo. CD progressors have a distinct gut microbiota composition, an increased IgA response, and unique IgA targets compared to healthy subjects. Notably, 26 plasma metabolites, five cytokines, and one chemokine were significantly altered in CD progressors at age 5. Among 26 metabolites, we identified a 2-fold increase in TDCA. TDCA treatment alone caused villous atrophy, increased CD4+ T cells, Natural Killer cells, and two important immunoregulatory proteins, Qa-1 and NKG2D expression on T cells while decreasing T-regulatory cells in intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in C57BL/6J mice. Pediatric CD progressors have a distinct gut microbiota composition, plasma metabolome, and cytokine profile before diagnosis. Furthermore, CD progressors have more IgA-coated bacteria and unique targets of IgA in their gut microbiota. TDCA feeding alone stimulates an inflammatory immune response in the small intestines of C57BJ/6 mice and causes villous atrophy, the hallmark of CD. Thus, a microbiota-derived metabolite, TDCA, enriched in CD progressors' plasma, has the potential to drive inflammation in the small intestines and enhance CD pathogenesis. Video Abstract.",

        "Abstract": "There is growing recognition that regionalization of bacterial colonization and immunity along the intestinal tract has an important role in health and disease. Yet, the mechanisms underlying intestinal regionalization and its dysregulation in disease are not well understood. This study found that regional epithelial expression of the transcription factor GATA4 controls bacterial colonization and inflammatory tissue immunity in the proximal small intestine by regulating retinol metabolism and luminal IgA. Furthermore, in mice without jejunal GATA4 expression, the commensal segmented filamentous bacteria promoted pathogenic inflammatory immune responses that disrupted barrier function and increased mortality upon Citrobacter rodentium infection. In celiac disease patients, low GATA4 expression was associated with metabolic alterations, mucosal Actinobacillus, and increased IL-17 immunity. Taken together, these results reveal broad impacts of GATA4-regulated intestinal regionalization on bacterial colonization and tissue immunity, highlighting an elaborate interdependence of intestinal metabolism, immunity, and microbiota in homeostasis and disease.",

        "Abstract": "Diet and commensals can affect the development of autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, whether dietary interventions are microbe-mediated was unclear. We found that a diet based on hydrolyzed casein (HC) as a protein source protects non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice in conventional and germ-free (GF) conditions via improvement in the physiology of insulin-producing cells to reduce autoimmune activation. The addition of gluten (a cereal protein complex associated with celiac disease) facilitates autoimmunity dependent on microbial proteolysis of gluten: T1D develops in GF animals monocolonized with Enterococcus faecalis harboring secreted gluten-digesting proteases but not in mice colonized with protease deficient bacteria. Gluten digestion by E.\u00a0faecalis generates T\u00a0cell-activating peptides and promotes innate immunity by enhancing macrophage reactivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Gnotobiotic NOD Toll4-negative mice monocolonized with E.\u00a0faecalis on an HC\u00a0+ gluten diet are resistant to T1D. These findings provide insights into strategies to develop dietary interventions to help protect humans against autoimmunity.",

        "Abstract": "Cuproptosis, a genetic process of copper-dependent cell death linked to mitochondria respiration, demonstrates its correlation with inhibiting tumoral angiogenesis and motility. Recent studies have developed systematic bioinformatics frameworks to identify the association of cuproptosis with tumors but any non-neoplastic diseases. Therefore, against the background of an increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the landscape of cuproptosis regulation in IBD is a critical need to be investigated. The differentially expressed cuproptosis-related genes (DECRGs) were identified with human sequencing profiles for four inflammatory digestive disorders. Another four independent IBD datasets from GEO were used as a validation cohort. And experimental mice model provides another validation method. Using single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, CIBERSORT, and consensus clustering algorithms, we explored the association between immune score and cuproptosis-related genes, as well as the diagnostic value of these genes. Molecular docking screened potential interaction of IBD drugs with the structural regulator by Autodock Vina. Cuproptosis-related regulators exhibited extensive differential expression in Crohn's Disease (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC), Celiac Disease (CEL), and IBD-induced cancer (IBD-CA) that share common differential genes (PDHA1, DBT, DLAT, LIAS). The differential expression of DECRGs was reverified in the validated cohort and immunohistochemistry assay. Moreover, the cell signaling pathways and ontology mainly focused on the mitochondrial respiratory function, which was highly enriched in Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). According to ssGSEA and ROC, when considering the four regulators, which showed robust association with immune infiltration in IBD, the area under the ROC (AUC) was 0.743. In addition, two clusters of consensus clustering based on the four regulators exhibit different immune phenotypes. According to molecular docking results, methotrexate gained the highest binding affinity to the main chain of key cuproptosis-related regulators compared with the remaining ten drugs. Cuproptosis-related regulators were widely linked to risk variants, immune cells, immune function, and drug efficacy in IBD. Regulation of cuproptosis may deeply influence the occurrence and development of patients with IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Immunoglobulin A (IgA) mediates mucosal responses to food antigens and the intestinal microbiome and is involved in susceptibility to mucosal pathogens, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and IgA nephropathy. We performed a genome-wide association study of serum IgA levels in 41,263 individuals of diverse ancestries and identified 20 genome-wide significant loci, including 9 known and 11 novel loci. Co-localization analyses with expression QTLs prioritized candidate genes for 14 of 20 significant loci. Most loci encoded genes that produced immune defects and IgA abnormalities when genetically manipulated in mice. We also observed positive genetic correlations of serum IgA levels with IgA nephropathy, type 2 diabetes, and body mass index, and negative correlations with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and several infections. Mendelian randomization supported elevated serum IgA as a causal factor in IgA nephropathy. African ancestry was consistently associated with higher serum IgA levels and greater frequency of IgA-increasing alleles compared to other ancestries. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of IgA levels and its potential role in human disease.",

        "Title": "Simvastatin reduced infiltration of memory subsets of T lymphocytes in the lung tissue during Th2 allergic inflammation.",
        "Abstract": "Lymphocytes infiltration is a key mechanism that drives asthma lung inflammation. Our previous results demonstrated a significant increase in the frequency and persistence of central memory T (T<sub>CM</sub>) cells in inflamed lung tissue. This could be due to an increase in the infiltration of T<sub>CM</sub> in the lung tissue, or the possible differentiation of lung effector memory T (T<sub>EM</sub>) cells into T<sub>CM</sub> during lung inflammation. Thus, targeting the accumulation of memory T cells provides a potential approach for asthma treatment. Simvastatin and other statins were shown to impact both the structural and immune lung cells, presenting a distinct immunomodulatory effect on T lymphocyte activation, infiltration, and function. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the effect of simvastatin on the frequency and function of CD4 and CD8 T<sub>EM</sub> and T<sub>CM</sub> cells in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse model of asthma. Simvastatin treatment significantly attenuated the infiltration of both T<sub>EM</sub> and T<sub>CM</sub> memory subtypes, along with their production of IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines in a T helper 2 (Th2) OVA-sensitized mouse model. Furthermore, we detected a reduction in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 levels in the lung homogenate of OVA-sensitized and challenged mice, as well as in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) following treatment with simvastatin. The reduction in leucocyte homing receptors following simvastatin treatment might have contributed to the observed decrease in infiltrated memory T cell numbers. In conclusion, this study demonstrated how statin drug may attenuate allergic asthma lung inflammation by targeting memory T cells and reducing their numbers, whilst limiting their cytokine production at the site of inflammation. Longer clinical trials are required to assess the effectiveness and safety of statin treatment in different asthma phenotypes.",

        "Abstract": "The frequency of celiac disease autoantibody (CDAb) positivity in type 1 diabetes (T1D) has increased due to unclear mechanisms, including autoimmune injury. Circular ribonucleic acids (circRNAs) participate in autoimmune diseases, but the roles of circRNAs in T1D with CDAbs are currently unknown. This study aimed to determine the frequency of CDAbs in Chinese children with T1D and describe the relationship between CDAbs and circRNAs. Eighty patients diagnosed with T1D were screened for CDAbs and CD-predisposing genes, and circRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 47 patients. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was searched for candidate circRNAs in related studies on T1D PBMCs. Data on clinical characteristics (i.e., blood glucose control, residual islet function, and daily insulin dosage) and immunophenotypes (i.e., islet autoantibodies and immune cell subsets) were collected. In total, 35.0% of patients were positive for CDAbs. CD-predisposing genes accounted for 52.5% of the genes, and no significant difference in frequency was found between the CDAb-positive (CDAb<sup>+</sup>) and CDAb-negative (CDAb<sup>-</sup>) groups. In addition, among the differentially expressed circRNAs from the GEO database, five highly conserved circRNAs homologous to humans and mice were screened, and only the expression of <i>hsa_circ_0004564</i> in the CDAb<sup>+</sup> group significantly decreased (CDAb<sup>+</sup> vs. CDAb<sup>-</sup>:1.72 \u00b1 1.92 vs. 11.12 \u00b1 8.59, <i>p</i> = 6.0 \u00d7 10<sup>-6</sup>), while the expression of <i>hsa_circ_0004564</i> was upregulated in the general T1D population. Moreover, its parental gene <i>RAPH1</i> was significantly upregulated (CDAb<sup>+</sup> vs. CDAb<sup>-</sup>:1.26 \u00b1 0.99 vs. 0.61 \u00b1 0.46, <i>p</i> = 0.011). Importantly, the positive correlation between <i>hsa_circ_0004564</i> and CD3<sup>+</sup> cells was validated in children with T1D after adjustments for CDAbs (<i>p</i> = 0.029), while there were no correlations between <i>hsa_circ_0004564</i> and clinical characteristics or other immune cell subsets (i.e., CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and natural killer cells). This study highlights the importance of screening for CD in Chinese children with T1D, considering the high prevalence of CDAb positivity and CD-predisposing genes. The profile of candidate circRNAs in children with T1D with CDAbs was different from that in previous reports on general T1D patients from the GEO database. Moreover, <i>hsa_circ_0004564</i> and its parental gene <i>RAPH1</i> may be new targets for studying immune mechanisms in children with T1D and CD.",

        "Title": "Unilateral Cervical Vagotomy Modulates Immune Cell Profiles and the Response to a Traumatic Brain Injury.",
        "Abstract": "TBI induces splenic B and T cell expansion that contributes to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The vagus nerve, the longest of the cranial nerves, is the predominant parasympathetic pathway allowing the central nervous system (CNS) control over peripheral organs, including regulation of inflammatory responses. One way this is accomplished is by vagus innervation of the celiac ganglion, from which the splenic nerve innervates the spleen. This splenic innervation enables modulation of the splenic immune response, including splenocyte selection, activation, and downstream signaling. Considering that the left and right vagus nerves have distinct courses, it is possible that they differentially influence the splenic immune response following a CNS injury. To test this possibility, immune cell subsets were profiled and quantified following either a left or a right unilateral vagotomy. Both unilateral vagotomies caused similar effects with respect to the percentage of B cells and in the decreased percentage of macrophages and T cells following vagotomy. We next tested the hypothesis that a left unilateral vagotomy would modulate the splenic immune response to a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Mice received a left cervical vagotomy or a sham vagotomy 3 days prior to a fluid percussion injury (FPI), a well-characterized mouse model of TBI that consistently elicits an immune and neuroimmune response. Flow cytometric analysis showed that vagotomy prior to FPI resulted in fewer CLIP+ B cells, and CD4+, CD25+, and CD8+ T cells. Vagotomy followed by FPI also resulted in an altered distribution of CD11b<sup>high</sup> and CD11b<sup>low</sup> macrophages. Thus, transduction of immune signals from the CNS to the periphery via the vagus nerve can be targeted to modulate the immune response following TBI.",

Celiac disease is a unique organ-specific autoimmune-like disorder occurring in genetically susceptible individuals carrying HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules who consume gluten. The key histological characteristic of the disease in humans is the destruction of the lining of the small intestine, a feature that has been difficult to reproduce in immunocompetent animal models. This unit describes the DQ8-D<sup>d</sup> -villin-IL-15 transgenic mouse model of CeD, which was engineered based on the knowledge acquired from studying CeD patients' intestinal samples, and which represents the first animal model that develops villous atrophy in an HLA- and gluten-dependent manner without administration of any adjuvant. We provide detailed protocols for inducing and monitoring intestinal tissue damage, evaluating the cytotoxic properties of intraepithelial lymphocytes that mediate enterocyte lysis, and assessing the activation of the enzyme transglutaminase 2, which contributes to the generation of highly immunogenic gluten peptides. Detailed protocols to prepare pepsin-trypsin digested gliadin (PT-gliadin) or chymotrypsin-digested gliadin (CT-gliadin), which allow antibody detection against native or deamidated gluten peptides, are also provided in this unit. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease is an immune-mediated intestinal disorder that results from loss of oral tolerance (LOT) to dietary gluten. Reovirus elicits inflammatory Th1 cells and suppresses Treg responses to dietary antigen in a strain-dependent manner. Strain type 1 Lang (T1L) breaks oral tolerance, while strain type 3 Dearing reassortant virus (T3D-RV) does not. We discovered that intestinal infection by T1L in mice leads to the recruitment and activation of NK cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) in a type I IFN-dependent manner. Once activated following infection, NK cells produce type II IFN and contribute to IFN-stimulated gene expression in the MLNs, which in turn induces inflammatory DC and T cell responses. Immune depletion of NK cells impairs T1L-induced LOT to newly introduced food antigen. These studies indicate that NK cells modulate the response to dietary antigen in the presence of a viral infection.",

        "Abstract": "Antibody-based therapeutics (ABTs) are used to treat a range of diseases. Most ABTs are either full-length IgG1 antibodies or fusions between for instance antigen (Ag)-binding receptor domains and the IgG1 Fc fragment. Interestingly, their plasma half-life varies considerably, which may relate to how they engage the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). As such, there is a need for an in-depth understanding of how different features of ABTs affect FcRn-binding and transport behavior. Here, we report on how FcRn-engagement of the IgG1 Fc fragment compare to clinically relevant IgGs and receptor domain Fc fusions, binding to VEGF or TNF-\u03b1. The results reveal FcRn-dependent intracellular accumulation of the Fc, which is in line with shorter plasma half-life than that of full-length IgG1 in human FcRn-expressing mice. Receptor domain fusion to the Fc increases its half-life, but not to the extent of IgG1. This is mirrored by a reduced cellular recycling capacity of the Fc-fusions. In addition, binding of cognate Ag to ABTs show that complexes of similar size undergo cellular transport at different rates, which could be explained by the biophysical properties of each ABT. Thus, the study provides knowledge that should guide tailoring of ABTs regarding optimal cellular sorting and plasma half-life.",

        "Abstract": "A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the only available therapy for coeliac disease (CD). However, GFD compliance is difficult and alternative strategies are envisaged in the near future. We previously found that wheat gliadin following transamidation by microbial transglutaminase (mTG) does not induce IFN-\u03b3 secretion by intestinal T cells from CD patients. Fully transamidated gliadin with lysine ethyl ester can be recovered in a soluble protein fraction (spf) generated by the enzymatic treatment of wheat flour. Herein, we analysed the performance of transamidation by mTG on a pilot-scale (1L) by evaluating the reaction kinetics and its biological effect on the intestinal immune response in HLA/DQ8 transgenic mice, a model of gluten sensitivity. At 1 h, all gliadin fractions showed a faster electrophoretic mobility by acid-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE) following transamidation in comparison with their native counterparts. In parallel, the yield of residual native gliadin dropped (30% at 180 min), confirming our previous findings on a lab scale. Mucosal sensitisation of mice with gliadin <i>via</i> the intranasal route induced a Th1 phenotype in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). Importantly, IFN-\u03b3 secretion was significantly reduced when gliadin-specific MLN cells were challenged <i>in vitro</i> with spf (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Multiplex analysis revealed that the adaptive immune response evoked by spf involved a distinct cell population characterised by secretion of IL-2, IL-3 and IL-5. Notably, spf stimulated <i>in vitro</i> a reduced or null secretion of all of the examined pro-inflammatory markers mainly associated to innate immunity. In conclusion, our data revealed the ability of transamidated gliadin to modulate both innate and adaptive mechanisms involved in the inflammatory response induced by wheat gliadin in the small intestine of DQ8 mice.",

Neprosin from the pitcher plant is a reported prolyl endopeptidase. Here, we produce recombinant neprosin and its mutants, and find that full-length neprosin is a zymogen, which is self-activated at gastric pH by the release of an all-\u03b2 pro-domain via a pH-switch mechanism featuring a lysine plug. The catalytic domain is an atypical 7+8-stranded \u03b2-sandwich with an extended active-site cleft containing an unprecedented pair of catalytic glutamates. Neprosin efficiently degrades both gliadin and the 33-mer in vitro under gastric conditions and is reversibly inactivated at pH\u2009>\u20095. Moreover, co-administration of gliadin and the neprosin zymogen at the ratio 500:1 reduces the abundance of the 33-mer in the small intestine of mice by up to 90%. Neprosin therefore founds a family of eukaryotic glutamate endopeptidases that fulfils requisites for a therapeutic glutenase.",

        "Abstract": "Genes and gluten are necessary but insufficient to cause celiac disease (CeD). Altered gut microbiota has been implicated as an additional risk factor. Variability in sampling site may confound interpretation and mechanistic insight, as CeD primarily affects the small intestine. Thus, we characterized CeD microbiota along the duodenum and in feces and verified functional impact in gnotobiotic mice. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Illumina) and predicted gene function (PICRUSt2) in duodenal biopsies (D1, D2 and D3), aspirates, and stool from patients with active CeD and controls. CeD alleles were determined in consented participants. A subset of duodenal samples stratified according to similar CeD risk genotypes (controls DQ2<sup>-/-</sup> or DQ2<sup>+/-</sup> and CeD DQ2<sup>+/-</sup>) were used for further analysis and to colonize germ-free mice for gluten metabolism studies. Microbiota composition and predicted function in CeD was largely determined by intestinal location. In the duodenum, but not stool, there was higher abundance of Escherichia coli (D1), Prevotella salivae (D2), and Neisseria (D3) in CeD vs controls. Predicted bacterial protease and peptidase genes were altered in CeD and impaired gluten degradation was detected only in mice colonized with CeD microbiota. Our results showed luminal and mucosal microbial niches along the gut in CeD. We identified novel microbial proteolytic pathways involved in gluten detoxification that are impaired in CeD but not in controls carrying DQ2, suggesting an association with active duodenal inflammation. Sampling site should be considered a confounding factor in microbiome studies in CeD.",

        "Abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by T and B cell responses to proteins expressed by insulin-producing pancreatic \u03b2 cells, inflammatory lesions within islets (insulitis), and \u03b2 cell loss. We previously showed that Ag-specific tolerance targeting single \u03b2 cell protein epitopes is effective in preventing T1D induced by transfer of monospecific diabetogenic CD4 and CD8 transgenic T cells to NOD.<i>scid</i> mice. However, tolerance induction to individual diabetogenic proteins, for example, GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase 65) or insulin, has failed to ameliorate T1D both in wild-type NOD mice and in the clinic. Initiation and progression of T1D is likely due to activation of T cells specific for multiple diabetogenic epitopes. To test this hypothesis, recombinant insulin, GAD65, and chromogranin A proteins were encapsulated within poly(d,l-lactic-<i>co</i>-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (COUR CNPs) to assess regulatory T cell induction, inhibition of Ag-specific T cell responses, and blockade of T1D induction/progression in NOD mice. Whereas treatment of NOD mice with CNPs containing a single protein inhibited the corresponding Ag-specific T cell response, inhibition of overt T1D development only occurred when all three diabetogenic proteins were included within the CNPs (CNP-T1D). Blockade of T1D following CNP-T1D tolerization was characterized by regulatory T cell induction and a significant decrease in both peri-insulitis and immune cell infiltration into pancreatic islets. As we have recently published that CNP treatment is both safe and induced Ag-specific tolerance in a phase 1/2a celiac disease clinical trial, Ag-specific tolerance induced by nanoparticles encapsulating multiple diabetogenic proteins is a promising approach to T1D treatment.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune intestinal disorder caused by the ingestion of gluten in people who carry the susceptible gene. In current celiac disease research, wheat gluten is often the main target of attention, neglecting the role played by non-gluten proteins. This study aimed to describe the effects of wheat amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATI, non-gluten proteins) and gliadin in BALB/c mice while exploring the further role of relevant adjuvants (cholera toxin, polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid and dextran sulfate sodium) intervention. An ex vivo splenocyte and intestinal tissue were collected for analysis of the inflammatory profile. The consumption of gliadin and ATI caused intestinal inflammation in mice. Moreover, the histopathology staining of four intestinal sections (duodenum, jejunum, terminal ileum, and middle colon) indicated that adjuvants, especially polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid, enhanced the villi damage and crypt hyperplasia in co-stimulation with ATI and gliadin murine model. Immunohistochemical results showed that tissue transglutaminase and IL-15 expression were significantly increased in the jejunal tissue of mice treated with ATI and gliadin. Similarly, the expression of inflammatory factors (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-13) and Th1/Th2 balance also showed that the inflammation response was significantly increased after co-stimulation with ATI and gliadin. This study provided new evidence for the role of wheat amylase trypsin inhibitors in the pathogenesis of celiac disease.",

        "Abstract": "Patients with gluten sensitivities present with dysbiosis of the gut microbiome that is further exacerbated by a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). A subtype of patients genetically susceptible to gluten sensitivities are Celiac Disease (CeD) patients, who are carriers of the HLA DR3/DQ2 or HLA DR4/DQ8 haplotypes. Although 85-95% of all CeD patients carry HLA DQ2, up to 25-50% of the world population carry this haplotype with only a minority developing CeD. This suggests that CeD and other gluten sensitivities are mediated by factors beyond genetics. The contribution of innate immune system signaling has been generally understudied in the context of gluten sensitivities. Thus, here we examined the role of NOD-like receptors (NLRs), a subtype of pattern recognition receptors, in maintaining the composition of the gut microbiome in animals maintained on a GFD. Human transcriptomics data revealed significant increases in the gene expression of multiple NLR family members, across functional groups, in patients with active CeD compared to control specimens. However, <i>NLRX1</i> was uniquely down-regulated during active disease. NLRX1 is a negative regulatory NLR that functions to suppress inflammatory signaling and has been postulate to prevent inflammation-induced dysbiosis. Using <i>Nlrx1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice maintained on either a normal or gluten-free diet, we show that loss of NLRX1 alters the microbiome composition, and a distinctive shift further ensues following adherence to a GFD, including a reciprocal loss of beneficial microbes and increase in opportunistic bacterial populations. Finally, we evaluated the functional impact of an altered gut microbiome by assessing short- and medium-chain fatty acid production. These studies revealed significant differences in a selection of metabolic markers that when paired with 16S rRNA sequencing data could reflect an overall imbalance and loss of immune system homeostasis in the gastrointestinal system.",

        "Abstract": "Cereals are known to trigger for wheat allergy, celiac disease and non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS). Inflammatory processes and intestinal barrier impairment are suspected to be involved in NCWS, although the molecular triggers are unclear. We were interested if different bread types influence inflammatory processes and intestinal barrier function in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Epithelial caspase-8 gene knockout (Casp8<sup>\u0394IEC</sup>) and control (Casp8<sup>fl</sup>) mice were randomized to eight groups, respectively. The groups received different diets for 28\u00a0days (gluten-free diet, gluten-rich diet 5\u00a0g%, or different types of bread at 50\u00a0g%). Breads varied regarding grain, milling and fermentation. All diets were isocaloric. Regardless of the diet, Casp8<sup>\u0394IEC</sup> mice showed pronounced inflammation in colon compared to ileum, whereas Casp8<sup>fl</sup> mice were hardly inflamed. Casp8<sup>fl</sup> mice could tolerate all bread types. Especially yeast fermented rye and wheat bread from superfine flour but not pure gluten challenge increased colitis and mortality in Casp8<sup>\u0394IEC</sup> mice. Hepatic expression of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and colonic expression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 genes were inversely related to survival. The bread diets, but not the gluten-rich diet, also decreased colonic tight junction expression to variable degrees, without clear association to survival and inflammation. Bread components, especially those from yeast-fermented breads from wheat and rye, increase colitis and mortality in Casp8<sup>\u0394IEC</sup> mice highly susceptible to intestinal inflammation, whereas control mice can tolerate all types of bread without inflammation. Yet unidentified bread components other than gluten seem to play the major role.",

Typical histopathologic features are villous flattening, crypt hyperplasia and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the intestinal epithelium and lamina propria. The disease is hallmarked by the gluten-dependent production of autoantibodies targeting the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2). While these antibodies are specific and sensitive diagnostic markers of the disease, a role in the development of the enteropathy has never been established. We addressed this question by injecting murine antibodies harboring the variable domains of a prototypic celiac anti-TG2 immunoglobulin into TG2-sufficient and TG2-deficient mice evaluating for celiac enteropathy. We found no histopathologic abnormalities nor clinical signs of disease related to the injection of anti-TG2 IgG or IgA.

        "Abstract": "In humans, celiac disease (CeD) is a T-cell-driven gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) localized to the small bowel (duodenum). The presence of antibodies specific for gluten- and self-antigens are commonly used diagnostic biomarkers of CeD and are considered to play a role in GSE pathogenesis. Previously, we have described an apparent T-cell-mediated GSE in CD19-/- mice, which develop weak and abnormal B cell responses. Here, we expand on this observation and use a mouse model of complete B cell deficiency (JH-/- mice), to show that absence of a humoral immune response also promotes development of a GSE. Furthermore, 16S analysis of microbial communities in the small intestine demonstrates that a gluten-free diet suppresses the expansion of anaerobic bacteria in the small intestine and colonization of the small intestine by a specific pathobiont. Finally, we also observe that SI enteropathy in mice fed a gluten-rich diet is positively correlated with the abundance of several microbial peptidase genes, which supports that bacterial metabolism of gluten may be an important driver of GSE in our model. Collectively, results from our experiments indicate that JH-/- mice will be a useful resource to investigators seeking to empirically delineate the contribution of humoral immunity on GSE pathogenesis, and support the hypothesis that humoral immunity promotes tolerance to gluten.",

In this study we evaluated the effect of oral administration of different doses of native vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in enteropathic mice. Female non-obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLt.J mice were fed standard or gluten-free diet and administered gliadin (5\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) to induce a celiac pathology. Healthy control (gluten-free diet, without gliadin) and control for pathology (standard diet, with gliadin) were administered olive oil. All other experimental groups received gliadin and standard diet plus oral cholecalciferol (5, 10, 20, 50 and 130\u00a0\u03bcg/kg). Serum levels of 25(OH)D3, calcium and zonulin and expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR), CD3 and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) by immunohistochemistry as well as intestinal histological and histomorphometric analyses were undertaken. Although no difference in serum levels of 25(OH)D3, calcium or zonulin was observed in cholecalciferol-treated mice vs. healthy controls, a significant improvement in intestinal mucosa pathological features in mice administered cholecalciferol was observed by histological analysis. Villi length was also significantly increased by cholecalciferol in a dose-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical staining revealed increased expression of CD3 and ZO-1 in celiac mice compared to mice receiving high dose (130\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) cholecalciferol. These findings show the effect of oral cholecalciferol on signature features of CD in a mouse model of CD.

In this report, we have isolated dermal fibroblasts from a female patient affected of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and obtained clones based on inactivation status of either maternally or paternally inherited X chromosome, followed by differentiation to hepatocytes. Hepatocyte-like cells derived from these clones display indistinct features characteristic of hepatocytes, but express either the mutant or wild type OTC allele depending on X-inactivation pattern. When clonally derived hepatocyte-like cells were transplanted into FRG<sup>\u00ae</sup> KO mice, they were able to colonize the liver and recapitulate OTC-dependent phenotype conditioned by X-chromosome inactivation pattern.

        "Abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that is increasing in prevalence worldwide. One of the contributing factors to the pathogenesis of T1D is the composition of the intestinal microbiota, as has been demonstrated. in T1D patients, with some studies demonstrating a deficiency in their levels of Prevotella. We have isolated a strain of Prevotella histicola from a duodenal biopsy that has anti-inflammatory properties, and in addition, alters the development of autoimmune diseases in mouse models. Therefore, our hypothesis is that the oral administration of P. histicola might delay the development of T1D in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. To assess this, we used the following materials and methods. Female NOD mice (ages 5-8\u2009weeks) were administered every other day P. histicola that was cultured in-house. Blood glucose levels were measured every other week. Mice were sacrificed at various time points for histopathological analysis of the pancreas. Modulation of immune response by the commensal was tested by analyzing regulatory T-cells and NKp46+ cells using flow cytometry and intestinal cytokine mRNA transcript levels using quantitative RT-PCR. For microbial composition, 16\u2009s rRNA gene analysis was conducted on stool samples collected at various time points. Administration of P. histicola in NOD mice delayed the onset of T1D. Beta diversity in the fecal microbiomes demonstrated that the microbial composition of the mice administered P. histicola was different from those that were not treated. Treatment with P. histicola led to a significant increase in regulatory T cells with a concomitant decrease in NKp46+ cells in the pancreatic lymph nodes as compared to the untreated group after 5\u2009weeks of treatment. These observations suggest that P. histicola treatment delayed onset of diabetes by increasing the levels of regulatory T cells in the pancreatic lymph nodes. This preliminary work supports the rationale that enteral exposure to a non pathogenic commensal P. histicola be tested as a future therapy for T1D.",

However, tissue distribution of effector memory (TEM) and central memory (TCM) T-cell subtypes, their differentiation, and their contribution to the persistence of lung tissue inflammation during asthma are not well understood. Interestingly, an increase in survival and persistence of memory T cells was reported in asthmatic lungs, which may suggest a shift toward the more persistent TCM phenotype. In this report, we investigated the differential distribution of memory T-cell subtypes during allergic lung inflammation and the mechanism regulating that. Using an OVA-sensitized asthma mouse model, we observed a significant increase in the frequency of TCM cells in inflamed lungs compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, adoptive transfer techniques confirmed substantial infiltration of TCM cells to lung tissues during allergic airway inflammation. Expression levels of TCM homing receptors, CD34 and GlyCAM-1, were also significantly upregulated in the lung tissues of OVA-sensitized mice, which may facilitate the increased TCM infiltration into inflamed lungs. Moreover, a substantial increase in the relative expression of TCM profile-associated genes (EOMES, BCL-6, ID3, TCF-7, BCL-2, BIM, and BMI-1) was noted for TEM cells during lung inflammation, suggesting a shift for TEM into the TCM state. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report an increased infiltration of TCM cells into inflamed lung tissues and to suggest differentiation of TEM to TCM cells in these tissues. Therapeutic interference at TCM infiltration or differentiations could constitute an alternative treatment approach for lung inflammation.",

Our aim was to investigate the role of PREP inhibitor KYP-2047 in tissue damage, angiogenesis, and endothelial barrier permeability after intestinal IRI in mice. KYP-2047 treatments were performed 5 min prior to intestinal damage. Intestinal IRI was induced in mice by clamping the superior mesenteric artery and the celiac trunk for 30 min, followed by 1 h of reperfusion. PREP inhibition by KYP-2047 treatment reduced intestinal IR-induced histological damage and neutrophil accumulation, limiting inflammation through decrease of NF-\u0138B nuclear translocation and fibrotic processes. KYP-2047 treatment restored barrier permeability and structural alteration following intestinal IRI, attenuating neovascular processes compromised by ischemia/reperfusion. Additionally, loss of epithelial cells during intestinal ischemia occurring by apoptosis was limited by KYP-2047 treatment, which showed strong effects counteracting apoptosis and DNA damage. These findings provide the first evidence that PREP inhibition through KYP-2047 inhibitor use could be a validate strategy for resolving alterations of intestinal epithelium the pathophysiology of intestinal disease.",

        "Abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that the nervous system is involved in tumor development in the periphery, however, the role of the central nervous system remains largely unknown. Here, by combining genetic, chemogenetic, pharmacological, and electrophysiological approaches, we show that hypothalamic oxytocin (Oxt)-producing neurons modulate colitis-associated cancer (CAC) progression in mice. Depletion or activation of Oxt neurons could augment or suppress CAC progression. Importantly, brain treatment with celastrol, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, excites Oxt neurons and inhibits CAC progression, and this anti-tumor effect was significantly attenuated in Oxt neuron-lesioned mice. Furthermore, brain treatment with celastrol suppresses sympathetic neuronal activity in the celiac-superior mesenteric ganglion (CG-SMG), and activation of \u03b22 adrenergic receptor abolishes the anti-tumor effect of Oxt neuron activation or centrally administered celastrol. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that hypothalamic Oxt neurons regulate CAC progression by modulating the neuronal activity in the CG-SMG. Stimulation of Oxt neurons using chemicals, for example, celastrol, might be a novel strategy for colorectal cancer treatment.",

In addition to nutrients, foods contain myriads of substances that can have either beneficial or detrimental effects on the animals consuming them. Consequently, all animals evolved defense mechanisms that protect them from harmful food components. These \"antitoxin\" defenses have some parallels with antimicrobial defenses and operate at a cost to the animal's fitness. These costs outweigh benefits when defense responses are exaggerated or mistargeted, resulting in adverse reactions to foods. Additionally, pathological effects of foods can stem from insufficient defenses, due to unabated toxicity of harmful food components. We discuss the structure of antitoxin defenses and how their failures can lead to a variety of adverse food reactions.",

While blood pressure control, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition, and immunosuppression may slow disease progression, low-protein diets, defined as a daily dietary protein intake of 0.6 to 0.8\u00a0g/kg body weight, may also decrease immune complex deposition and disease severity, as evidenced in animal models. The link between secondary immunoglobulin A nephropathy and celiac disease has also led to the rise of gluten-free diets and zinc supplementation as potential lifestyle modifications to help manage common immunoglobulin A nephropathy symptoms such as proteinuria and hematuria. In addition, case reports and prospective studies suggest that patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which manifests as steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome may also benefit from a gluten-free diet. We highlight the example of a gluten-free, plant-dominant low-protein diet (a different type of low-protein diet that addresses both protein quantity and quality) for patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.",

        "Abstract": "Barley ranks fourth in global cereal production and is primarily grown for animal feed and malt. Hordeins, the principal barley seed storage proteins, are homologous to wheat gluten and when ingested elicit an immune response in people with Coeliac disease. Ris\u00f8 1508 is a chemically induced barley mutant with low hordein levels imparted by the lys3.a locus that is reported to be caused by an SNP in the barley prolamin-box binding factor gene (BPBF). Reports suggest the lys3.a locus prevents CG DNA demethylation at the Hor2 (B-hordein) promoter during grain development subsequently causing hypermethylation and inhibiting gene expression. In lys3.a mutants, endosperm-specific \u03b2-amylase (Bmy1) and Hor2 are similarly downregulated during grain development and thus we hypothesize that the inability to demethylate the Bmy1 promoter CG islands is also causing Bmy1 downregulation. We use whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and mRNA-seq on developing endosperms from two lys3.a mutants and a lys3.b mutant to determine all downstream genes affected by lys3 mutations. RNAseq analysis identified 306 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared between all mutants and their parents and 185 DEGs shared between both lys3.a mutants and their parents. Global DNA methylation levels and promoter CG DNA methylation levels were not significantly different between the mutants and their parents and thus refute the hypothesis that the lys3.a mutant's phenotype is caused by dysregulation of demethylation during grain development. The majority of DEGs were downregulated (e.g., B- and C-hordeins and Bmy1), but some DEGs were upregulated (e.g., \u03b2-glucosidase, D-hordein) suggesting compensatory effects and potentially explaining the low \u03b2-glucan phenotype observed in lys3.a germplasm. These findings have implications on human health and provide novel insight to barley breeders regarding the use of BPBF transcription factor mutants to create gluten-free barley varieties.",

This review explores the multifaceted role of non-host factors in CeD development, including dietary and microbial influences. We discuss clinical associations and observations highlighting the impact of these factors on disease onset and severity. Furthermore, we discuss studies in CeD-relevant animal models that offer mechanistic insights into how diet, the microbiome, and enteric infections modulate CeD pathogenesis.

        "Abstract": "<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L., commonly known as barley, is primarily used for animal feed and malting. The major storage proteins in barley are hordeins, known triggers of celiac disease (CD). Here, sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH)-MS proteomics was employed to investigate the proteome profile of grain and malt samples from the malting barley cultivar Sloop and single-, double-, and triple hordein-reduced lines bred in a Sloop background. Using a discovery proteomics approach, 2688 and 3034 proteins were detected from the grain and malt samples, respectively. By utilizing label-free relative quantitation through SWATH-MS, a total of 2654 proteins have been quantified from grain and malt. The comparative analyses between the barley grain and malt samples revealed that the C-hordein-reduced lines have a more significant impact on proteome level changes due to malting than B- and D-hordein-reduced lines. Upregulated proteins in C-hordein-reduced lines were primarily involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid peroxidation processes to provide more energy for seed germination during malting. By applying proteomics approaches after malting in hordein-reduced barley lines, we uncovered additional changes in the proteome driven by the genetic background that were not apparent in the sound grain. Our findings offer valuable insights for barley breeders and maltsters seeking to understand and optimize the performance of gluten-free grains in malt products.",

This pathology is triggered by immunogenic peptides generated from gliadins present in gluten, which act on the intestinal mucosa in a context of high intestinal permeability, activating the innate and adaptive response of the immune system. Several in vivo rodent models attempt to reproduce some phases of the intestinal inflammatory process that occurs in celiac disease. Allergic sensitization to gluten simulates, or enhances in some animal models, the loss of tolerance to gliadin peptides and the initial events that lead to celiac disease in a specific genetic or environmental context.

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CeD) is a primary malabsorption syndrome with no specific therapy, which greatly affects the quality of life. Since the pathogenesis of CeD remains riddled, based on multiple transcriptome profiles, this study aimed to establish an immune interaction network and elucidated new mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of CeD, providing potentially new evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of CeD. Three microarray and three RNA sequencing datasets of human duodenal tissue with or without CeD were included in Gene Expression Omnibus and respectively merged into derivation and validation cohorts. Differential expression gene and functional enrichment analysis were developed, then pyroptosis enrichment score (PES) model was established to quantify pyroptosis levels. Immune infiltration and co-expression network were constructed based on Xcell database. Protein-protein interaction and weighted gene co-expression network analysis were determined to identify pyroptosis relative hub genes, whose predictive efficiency were tested using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. CeD animal and in vitro cell line models were established to verify the occurrence of pyroptosis and molecules expression employing immunofluorescence, western blotting, cell counting kit-8 assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Analysis of single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) was performed using \"Seurat\" R package. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (137) were identified in derivation cohort whose function was mainly enriched in interferon response and suppression of metabolism. Since an enrichment of pyroptosis pathway in CeD was unexpectedly discovered, a PES model with high efficiency was constructed and verified with two external databases, which confirmed that pyroptosis was significantly upregulated in CeD epithelia. \u03b3\u03b4T cells exhibited high expression of IFN-\u03b3 were the most relevant cells associated with pyroptosis and occupied a greater weight in the LASSO predictive model of CeD. An accumulation of GSDMD expressed in epithelia was identified using scRNAseq, while animal model and in vitro experiments confirmed that epithelium cells were induced to become \"pre-pyroptotic\" status via IFN-\u03b3/IRF1/GSDMD axis. Furthermore, gluten intake triggered pyroptosis via caspase-1/GSDMD/IL-1\u03b2 pathway.

Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to identify specific disease prevention or therapeutic solutions targeting the gut microbiota, especially during infancy, which is the window of the human gut microbiota establishment process. In this review, we provide an overview of current knowledge concerning the relationship between disturbances in the gut microbiota early in life and health consequences later in life (e.g., necrotizing enterocolitis, celiac disease, asthma, allergies, autism spectrum disorders, overweight/obesity, diabetes and growth retardation), with a focus on changes in the gut microbiota prior to disease onset. In addition, we summarize and discuss potential microbiota-based interventions early in life (e.g., diet adjustments, probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, environmental changes) to promote health or prevent the development of specific diseases. This knowledge should aid the understanding of early life microbiology and inform the development of prediction and prevention measures for short- and long-term health disorders based on the gut microbiota.",

        "Abstract": "Untreated celiac disease (CD) patients have increased levels of blood glutamine and a lower duodenal expression of glutaminase (GLS). Intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN) is a process through which glutamine is turned into glucose in the small intestine, for which GLS is crucial. Animal studies suggest impaired IGN may have long-term effects on metabolic control and be associated with the development of type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to thoroughly investigate IGN at the gene expression level in children with untreated celiac disease. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to quantify the expression of 11 target genes related to IGN using the delta-delta Ct method with three reference genes (GUSB, IPO8, and YWHAZ) in duodenal biopsies collected from 84 children with untreated celiac disease and 58 disease controls. Significantly lower expression of nine target genes involved in IGN was seen in duodenal biopsies from CD patients compared with controls: FBP1, G6PC, GLS, GPT1, PCK1, PPARGC1A, SLC2A2, SLC5A1, and SLC6A19. No significant difference in the expression was observed for G6PC3 or GOT1. Children with untreated celiac disease have lower expression of genes important for IGN. Further studies are warranted to disentangle whether this is a consequence of intestinal inflammation or due to an impaired metabolic pathway shared with other chronic metabolic diseases. Impaired IGN could be a mechanism behind the increased risk of NAFLD seen in CD patients.",

Thus, the objective of the present work was to develop a gluten-free nutritionally balanced wafer formulation with a high content of antioxidants. First, the animal fat used in the traditional formulation was successfully replaced by high oleic sunflower. Second, the antioxidant content of several flavourings (cinnamon/honey/anise/vanilla) was measured and their addition to a gluten-free wafer formulation was evaluated. Third, multivariate statistical tools were used to select the formulation that properly mimicked the characteristics of a gluten-containing wafer. According to the results, anise and cinnamon were the most suitable flavourings to prepare gluten-free wafers, and the sensory analysis concluded that these formulations were highly acceptable (means>6.7 on the hedonic scale). Finally, the storage time analysis indicated that the texture of the gluten-free wafers was more susceptible to water absorption than gluten-containing wafers. Besides, cinnamon wafers presented a higher bioaccessible antioxidant capacity than anise wafers (43.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2005mg Trolox/g and 18.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9\u2005mg Trolox/g respectively) (p\u2009<\u20090.05), which remained stable for four months.

Celiac disease is a unique organ-specific autoimmune-like disorder occurring in genetically susceptible individuals carrying HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules who consume gluten. The key histological characteristic of the disease in humans is the destruction of the lining of the small intestine, a feature that has been difficult to reproduce in immunocompetent animal models. This unit describes the DQ8-D<sup>d</sup> -villin-IL-15 transgenic mouse model of CeD, which was engineered based on the knowledge acquired from studying CeD patients' intestinal samples, and which represents the first animal model that develops villous atrophy in an HLA- and gluten-dependent manner without administration of any adjuvant. We provide detailed protocols for inducing and monitoring intestinal tissue damage, evaluating the cytotoxic properties of intraepithelial lymphocytes that mediate enterocyte lysis, and assessing the activation of the enzyme transglutaminase 2, which contributes to the generation of highly immunogenic gluten peptides.

Over the few last decades, several new atypical cases have been identified through improved diagnostic tools. On the other hand, the onset of CD at a later age, including atypical CD forms whose clinical picture overlaps with other autoimmune diseases, shows that currently there are several unknown gene mutations, which could be responsible for the disease development. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is entity included by the ingestion of gluten leading to intestinal, or extraintestinal symptoms that improve once the gluten is removed from the nutrition. In this article relationships between genetically modified rodent animals with previously unknown multiple organ changes and CD, respectively NCGS are reviewed. Relationships between the small bowel histological changes and other organs pathology are discussed. Results of research document that changes have similar genetic background and can develop to serious autoimmune systematic diseases, including small bowel inflammation resembling atypical CD or NCGS. These may have extra-intestinal symptomatology but without a clear explanation of causes and differences in their manifestations. Research on animal models helps to discover links between several disorders associated with gastrointestinal damage. New methods based on individual gene mutations can help in atypical adult CD and NCGS recognitions in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Proteases or peptidases are hydrolases that catalyze the breakdown of polypeptide chains into smaller peptide subunits. Proteases exist in all life forms, including archaea, bacteria, protozoa, insects, animals, and plants due to their vital functions in cellular processing and regulation. There are several classes of proteases in the MEROPS database based on their catalytic mechanisms. This review focuses on post-proline cleaving enzymes (PPCEs) from different peptidase families, as well as prolyl endoprotease/oligopeptidase (PEP/POP) from the serine peptidase family. To date, most PPCEs studied are of microbial and animal origins. Recently, there have been reports of plant PPCEs. The most common PEP/POP are members of the S9 family that comprise two conserved domains. The substrate-limiting \u03b2-propeller domain prevents unwanted digestion, while the \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase catalyzes the reaction at the carboxyl-terminal of proline residues. PPCEs display preferences towards the Pro-X bonds for hydrolysis. This level of selectivity is substantial and has benefited the brewing industry, therapeutics for celiac disease by targeting proline-rich substrates, drug targets for human diseases, and proteomics analysis. Protein engineering via mutagenesis has been performed to improve heat resistance, pepsin-resistant capability, specificity, and protein turnover of PPCEs for pharmacological applications. This review aims to synthesize recent structure-function studies of PPCEs from different families of peptidases to provide insights into the molecular mechanism of prolyl cleaving activity. Despite the non-exhaustive list of PPCEs, this is the first comprehensive review to cover the biochemical properties, biological functions, and biotechnological applications of PPCEs from the diverse taxa.",

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the inherited deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), by causing impaired antioxidant defense, may increase the risk of CD. A retrospective monocentric case-control study was performed using the clinical records of 8338 outpatients (64.6% women) scheduled for upper endoscopy between 2002 and 2021 in Northern Sardinia. Overall, 627 were found to have CD (7.5%), and 1027 resulted to be G6PD-deficiency carriers (12.3%). Since randomization was impractical, the potential covariates imbalance between cases and controls was minimized using a 1:2 propensity-score-matched (PSM) analysis. Overall, G6PD deficiency was associated with increased risk of CD (odds ratio (OR) 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-1.90). The PSM procedure identified 1027 G6PD-deficient and 2054 normal patients. Logistic regression including the propensity score detected for G6PD deficiency an OR of 1.48 (95%CI 1.13-1.95; <i>p</i> = 0.004).

Although the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are not clear, the role of low-grade inflammation and mucosal immune activation in IBS symptom generation has become evident also in subsets of pediatric patients. Animal models provided meaningful insight in the causal relationship between abnormal mucosal immune activation and changes in gastrointestinal (GI) sensory-motor function. Likewise, the development of long-standing GI symptoms fulfilling the current criteria for functional GI disorders after infection gastroenteritis and in patients with IBD or celiac disease in remission further supports this hypothesis. Immune activation, its impact on gut sensory-motor function, and potential implications for symptom generation emerged in both children and adults with IBS. The aim of this review is to summarize the main evidence on the presence of low-grade inflammation and immune activation in children with IBS, its possible role in symptom generation, and its potential implication for new therapeutic strategies.",

        "Abstract": "Amylase/trypsin inhibitors (ATIs) are widely consumed in cereal-based foods and have been implicated in adverse reactions to wheat exposure, such as respiratory and food allergy, and intestinal responses associated with coeliac disease and non-coeliac wheat sensitivity. ATIs occur in multiple isoforms which differ in the amounts present in different types\u00a0of wheat (including ancient and modern ones). Measuring ATIs and their isoforms is an analytical challenge as is their isolation for use in studies addressing their potential effects on the human body. ATI isoforms differ in their spectrum of bioactive effects in the human gastrointestinal (GI), which may include enzyme inhibition, inflammation and immune responses and of which much is not known. Similarly, although modifications during food processing (exposure to heat, moisture, salt, acid, fermentation) may affect their structure and activity as shown in vitro, it is important to relate these changes to effects that may present in the GI tract. Finally, much of our knowledge of their potential biological effects is based on studies\u00a0in vitro\u00a0and in animal models. Validation by human studies using processed foods as commonly consumed is warranted. We conclude that more detailed understanding of these factors may allow the effects of ATIs on human health to be better understood and when possible, to be ameliorated, for example by innovative food processing. We therefore review in short our current knowledge of these proteins, focusing on features which relate to their biological activity and identifying gaps in our knowledge and research priorities.",

        "Abstract": "Autoimmune diseases are disorders that destruct or disrupt the body's own tissues by its own immune system. Several studies have revealed that polymorphisms of multiple genes are involved in autoimmune diseases. Meanwhile, gene therapy has become a promising approach in autoimmune diseases, and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) has become one of the most prominent methods. It has been shown that CRISPR-Cas9 can be applied to knock out proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) or block PCSK9, resulting in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In other studies, it can be used to treat rare diseases such as ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency and hereditary tyrosinemia. However, few studies on the treatment of autoimmune disease using CRISPR-Cas9 have been reported so far. In this review, we highlight the current and potential use of CRISPR-Cas9 in the management of autoimmune diseases. We summarize the potential target genes for immunomodulation using CRISPR-Cas9 in autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), psoriasis, and type 1 coeliac disease. This article will give a new perspective on understanding the use of CRISPR-Cas9 in autoimmune diseases not only through animal models but also in human models. Emerging approaches to investigate the potential target genes for CRISPR-Cas9 treatment may be promising for the tailored immunomodulation of some autoimmune diseases in the near future.",

        "Abstract": "We have shown that PLG nanoparticles loaded with peptide antigen can reduce disease in animal models of autoimmunity and in a phase 1/2a clinical trial in celiac patients. Clarifying the mechanisms by which antigen-loaded nanoparticles establish tolerance is key to further adapting them to clinical use. The mechanisms underlying tolerance induction include the expansion of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells and sequestration of autoreactive cells in the spleen. In this study, we employed nanoparticles loaded with two model peptides, GP<sub>33-41</sub> (a CD8 T cell epitope derived from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) and OVA<sub>323-339</sub> (a CD4 T cell epitope derived from ovalbumin), to modulate the CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from two transgenic mouse strains, P14 and DO11.10, respectively. Firstly, it was found that the injection of P14 mice with particles bearing the MHC I-restricted GP<sub>33-41</sub> peptide resulted in the expansion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with a regulatory cell phenotype. This correlated with reduced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell viability in ex vivo co-cultures. Secondly, both nanoparticle types were able to sequester transgenic T cells in secondary lymphoid tissue. Flow cytometric analyses showed a reduction in the surface expression of chemokine receptors. Such an effect was more prominently observed in the CD4<sup>+</sup> cells rather than the CD8<sup>+</sup> cells.",

        "Abstract": "Most gastrointestinal diseases and disorders (GIDD) are associated with depression, anxiety, and cognitive dysfunction. This suggests that shared features of GIDD, particularly chronic pain and inflammation, affect specific neural targets. The critical review of clinical and animal research presented here reveals that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a primary target. It is particularly sensitive to neuroinflammation, and its function accounts for altered mental function emergent in GIDD. We propose that peripherally-triggered neuroinflammation normally signals injury/illness to ACC, which increases threat assessment and pain sensitivity to cope with increased vulnerability. Chronic peripheral inflammation over-drives this process, leading to long-term ACC structural remodeling, and excessive threat signaling. This evokes anxiodepressive phenotypes even without direct evidence of threats because ACC utilizes schemas to infer affective outcomes (e.g. pain) based on complex contextual information. This activates the autonomic nervous system, exacerbates immune dysfunction, and promotes further gut pathology. This theory provides a mechanistic account of bidirectional interactions among gastrointestinal, immunological, and neural systems in GIDD, and is likely applicable to other chronic inflammatory conditions.",

While mucosal adaptation due to malnutrition, leading to villous atrophy, has been reported in paediatric populations in Africa and South America, in hibernating animals and animal models of experimental starvation, there is very little literature on adult human subjects. We report a case of a 76-year-old gentleman, presenting with chronic metabolic acidosis and anorexia who was found to have villous atrophy on duodenal biopsy, in the absence of any evidence of coeliac disease or other non-coeliac enteropathy. The nutritional state improved with correction of the underlying metabolic abnormality, and serial endoscopic assessment showed improvement in the villous atrophy.

This disease is characterized by severe diarrhea, weight loss and enteropathy. Although there are many case reports associated with olmesartan-related enteropathy in humans, it has not been described in a long-term animal model study so far. We developed a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (OM-SMEDDS) in our previous study to reduce this side effect of the drug and to enhance bioavailability. In this study, an artificial hypertension model was established with a dose of 185 \u03bcmol /kg L-NAME (N \u03c9-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) twice in a day intraperitoneally in Wistar albino rats. To determine and compare side effects, the OM-Suspension and OM-SMEDDS were administered at 1.3 mg/kg therapeutic dose during one-month period to the rats. Tension of rats was recorded by measuring from their tails with non invasive blood pressure system. We observed celiac like enteropathy findings like villous atrophy and intraepithelial lymphocytosis and clinical changes like weight loss and severe diarrhea after the treatment with OM-Suspension during one-month experiment. It was also observed that the antihypertensive efficacy of the OM-SMEDDS formulation was higher than the suspension during the experiment, which did not cause enteropathy, diarrhea and weight loss by reducing intestinal exposure. Hereby, we evaluated the side effects of two different pharmaceutical forms by designing a sustainable and reproducible celiac rat model that can be induced with olmesartan medoxomil.",

LA is currently being studied in phase III clinical trials and is orally administered to adult patients with celiac disease as an adjunct therapeutic to enhance intestinal barrier function that has been disrupted by gliadin-induced immune reactivity. Mechanistically, LA is thought to act as a zonulin antagonist to reduce zonulin-induced increases in barrier permeability and has been associated with the redistribution and rearrangement of tight junction proteins and actin filaments to restore intestinal barrier function. More recently, LA has been linked to inhibition of myosin light chain kinase, which likely reduces tension on actin filaments, thereby facilitating tight junction closure. Small (rodent) and large (porcine) animal studies have been conducted that demonstrate the importance of LA as a tight junction regulatory peptide in conditions other than celiac disease, including collagen-induced arthritis in mice and intestinal ischemic injury in pigs.",

However, the mechanisms involved in modifying gastrointestinal pathophysiology have not yet been fully explained. To evaluate its effects on gastrointestinal motility and the involvement of the vagal and splanchnic pathways. Male Wistar rats (250-300 g, n = 84) were used and divided into two groups. Group I (6-OHDA) received an intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (21 \u00b5g/animal). Group II (control) received a saline solution (NaCl, 0.9%) under the same conditions. The study of gastric emptying, intestinal transit, gastric compliance and operations (vagotomy and splanchnotomy) were performed 14 days after inducing neurodegeneration. Test meal (phenol red 5% glucose) was used to assess the rate of gastric emptying and intestinal transit. Parkinson's disease delayed gastric emptying and intestinal transit at all time periods studied; however, changes in gastric compliance were not observed. The delay in gastric emptying was reversed by pretreatment with vagotomy and splanchnotomy+celiac gangliectomy, thus suggesting the involvement of such pathways in the observed motor disorders. Parkinson's disease compromises gastric emptying, as well as intestinal transit, but does not alter gastric compliance. The delay in gastric emptying was reversed by truncal vagotomy, splanchnotomy and celiac ganglionectomy, suggesting the involvement of such pathways in delaying gastric emptying.",

        "Abstract": "Spinal cord injury is a devastating complication of aortic repair. Despite developments for the prevention and treatment of spinal cord injury, its incidence is still considerably high and therefore, influences patient outcome. Microcirculation plays a key role in tissue perfusion and oxygen supply and is often dissociated from macrohemodynamics. Thus, direct evaluation of spinal cord microcirculation is essential for the development of microcirculation-targeted therapies and the evaluation of existing approaches in regard to spinal cord microcirculation. However, most of the methods do not provide real-time assessment of spinal cord microcirculation. The aim of this study is to describe a standardized protocol for real-time spinal cord microcirculatory evaluation using laser-Doppler needle probes directly inserted in the spinal cord. We used a porcine model of ischemia/reperfusion to induce deterioration of the spinal cord microcirculation. In addition, a fluorescent microsphere injection technique was used. Initially, animals were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. Thereafter, laser-Doppler needle probe insertion was performed, followed by the placement of cerebrospinal fluid drainage. A median sternotomy was performed for exposure of the descending aorta to perform aortic cross-clamping. Ischemia/reperfusion was induced by supra-celiac aortic cross-clamping for a total of 48 min, followed by reperfusion and hemodynamic stabilization. Laser-Doppler Flux was performed in parallel with macrohemodynamic evaluation. In addition, automated cerebrospinal fluid drainage was used to maintain a stable cerebrospinal pressure. After completion of the protocol, animals were sacrificed, and the spinal cord was harvested for histopathological and microsphere analysis. The protocol reveals the feasibility of spinal cord microperfusion measurements using laser-Doppler probes and shows a marked decrease during ischemia as well as recovery after reperfusion. Results showed comparable behavior to fluorescent microsphere evaluation. In conclusion, this new protocol might provide a useful large animal model for future studies using real-time spinal cord microperfusion assessment in ischemia/reperfusion conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Immune-mediated liver and gastrointestinal diseases are chronic conditions that lack curative treatments. Despite advances in the understanding and treatment of these conditions, they frequently remain refractory to treatment and represent a significant unmet need. Cellular therapies are an emerging option and hold the potential to have a major impact. A literature review was carried out using Pubmed. Keywords used for search were 'ATMP', 'immune mediated', 'autoimmune liver disease' and 'immune mediated gastrointestinal conditions', 'cell therapy', 'MSC', 'HSCT', 'Regulatory T cells', 'GVHD', 'Coeliac disease' 'IBD', 'PSC', 'AIH', 'PBC'. No new data were generated or analysed in support of this review. There is substantial evidence from clinical trials to support the use of cell therapies as a treatment for immune-mediated liver and gastrointestinal conditions. Cellular therapy products have the ability to 'reset' the dysregulated immune system and this in turn can offer a longer term remission. There are ongoing clinical trials with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and other cells to evidence their efficacy profile and fill the gaps in current knowledge. Insights gained will inform future trial designs and subsequent therapeutic applications. There remains some uncertainty around the extrapolation of results from animal studies to clinical trials. Longevity of the therapeutic effects seen after the use of cell therapy needs to be scrutinized further. Heterogeneity in the selection of cells, source, methods of productions and cell administration pose challenges to the interpretation of the data. MSCs are emerging as a key therapeutic cells in immune-mediated liver and gastrointestinal conditions. Ongoing trials with these cells will provide new insights and a better understanding thus informing future larger scale studies. Larger scale clinical trials to build on the evidence from small studies regarding safety and efficacy of cellular therapy are still needed before cellular therapies can become off the shelf treatments. Alignment of academia and industry to standardize the processes involved in cell selection, manipulation and expansion and subsequent use in clinical trials is an important avenue to explore further.",

However, proportionally, fewer clinical trials have utilized monoclonal therapies or FMT than polyclonal therapies for treating autoimmune diseases, even though bacterial mono-therapies do inhibit the development of autoimmune diseases and/or delay the onset of autoimmune diseases in rodent models of those autoimmune diseases. In this review then, we review the previously completed and currently ongoing clinical trials that are testing bacterial therapies (FMT, monoclonal, and polyclonal) to treat common autoimmune dseases and discuss the successes in using bacterial monotherapies to treat rodent models of these common autoimmune diseases.",

        "Title": "Update on celiac disease.",
        "Abstract": "The purpose of this review is to describe current updates in celiac disease. Recent developments in the understanding of the pathogenesis of celiac disease continue to emerge that may implicate the role of gluten exposure. Several studies have shown that the amount of gluten consumed by the infant may affect the age of onset of celiac disease in genetically predisposed individuals. New guidelines from the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition allow serology-based celiac diagnosis, omitting endoscopic biopsies, in children. Recent data and updated guidelines in adults no longer support biopsies in all patients who are genetically susceptible with celiac disease who have been identified by serology with clinical signs and symptoms of celiac disease. A new assay was identified in the immune response to epitopes of the tissue transglutaminase-deamidated gliadin peptide complex. In addition, a recent study shows that serum IL-2 elevations correlate with timing and severity of symptoms after gluten ingested in celiac disease patients. Measuring gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs) in the stool of celiac patients may help monitor adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Of importance, we should be aware that the quality of life is affected in celiac disease patients. During adolescence, the education on the importance of long-term follow-up with an adult gastroenterologist is associated with more successful rates of medical care transition for young adults with celiac disease. Latiglutenase, an orally administered mixture of two gluten-specific recombinant proteases that degrades gluten proteins into small physiologically irrelevant fragments, is currently in a phase 2 trial. Latiglutenase has shown to be safe and effective in reducing symptoms of celiac disease patients upon a GFD with improvement of quality of life. Lastly, a recent study describes a mouse model that is characteristic of celiac disease. Our knowledge of celiac disease continues to grow with increasing evidence of contributory factors to its pathogenesis. There is some evidence that the quantity ingested of gluten by the infant effects the age of onset of celiac disease in genetically susceptible patients. Changes have been made to the guidelines in the diagnosis of celiac disease proposed by new studies. Recent studies have shown the significant effects on quality of life for celiac patients. As improved laboratory methods continue to be developed, these tests can have utility in both diagnosis of celiac disease and monitoring adherence to the GFD. Current therapeutic trials offer promising nondietary treatment for celiac patients. The development of an animal model can provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of celiac disease.",

        "Abstract": "Emerging information suggests that gastrointestinal and systemic pathology states may affect expression and function of membrane transporters in the gastrointestinal tract. Altered status of the transporters could affect drug as well as endogenous compounds handling with subsequent clinical consequences. It seems that in some pathologies, e.g., liver or kidney failure, changes in the intestinal transporter function provide compensatory functions, eliminating substrates excreted by dysfunctional organs. A literature search was conducted on Ovid and Pubmed databases to select relevant in vitro, animal and human studies that have reported expression, protein abundance and function of intestinal drug transporters. The accumulated data suggest that gastrointestinal pathology (inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, cholestasis) as well as systemic pathologies (kidney failure, liver failure, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, obesity, diabetes mellitus, systemic inflammation and Alzheimer disease) may affect drug transporter expression and function in the gastrointestinal tract. The altered status of drug transporters may provide compensatory activity in handling endogenous compounds, affect local drug actions in the gastrointestinal tract as well as impact drug bioavailability.",

        "Abstract": "Pancreaticoduodenal artery (PDA) aneurysm and celiac artery (CA) stenosis are rare diseases in themselves. Interestingly, however, there are more cases documented in the literature in which these two disease entities occurred together than could be coincidental, and CA stenosis has been suggested as the provocative condition in developing PDA aneurysm. This study is aimed at examining the causal relationship between CA stenosis and PDA aneurysm by simulating the splanchnic circulation with an electric circuit. A patient with multiple PDA aneurysms and collaterals with CA stenosis was treated in our institution using hybrid techniques. The patient's pre- and postoperative status was simulated using an electric circuit, and the two possible scenarios were tested for compatibility: the stenosis-first scenario <i>vs.</i> the aneurysm-first scenario. The simulation was performed in two ways: using Simulink\u00ae software (MATLAB\u00ae Release 2018b) and actual circuit construction on a breadboard. The stenosis-first scenario showed that as the CA stenosis progresses, the blood flow through PDA increases, favoring the development of an aneurysm and/or collaterals if the artery was already compromised by a weakening condition. On the other hand, the aneurysm-first scenario also showed that if the aneurysm or collaterals developed first, the aneurysm will steal the blood flow through the CA, causing it to collapse if the artery was already compromised by increased wall tension. Contrary to the common belief, this study showed that in patients suffering from concurrent CA stenosis and PDA aneurysm, either condition could develop first and predispose the development of the other. The simulation of splanchnic blood flow with an electric circuit provides a useful tool for analyzing rare vascular diseases that are difficult to provoke in clinical and animal studies.",

        "Abstract": "Patients and providers alike are highly interested in identifying potentially useful dietary interventions in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). This review examines the clinical associations of celiac disease (CeD), non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), and IBD with a focus on available data of the therapeutic efficacy of gluten-free diet (GFD) or low-gluten-containing diets in the therapy of IBD. There is a strong association between CeD and microscopic colitis, but the prevalence of CeD among IBD patients is similar to that of the general population. Interestingly, in cross-sectional studies nearly one-third of IBD patients report a diagnosis of NCGS, and many follow a GFD. Although animal studies have shown that gluten ingestion may promote intestinal inflammation and increase intestinal permeability, there have been no prospective studies evaluating the role of a GFD in the induction and maintenance of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Several cross-sectional reports suggest that a GFD may improve symptoms in IBD patients, but due to a lack of high-quality prospective clinical studies, current data do not support the universal use of a GFD in IBD.",

        "Abstract": "Abnormalities in the intestinal barrier are a possible cause of celiac disease (CD) development. In animal studies, the positive effect of prebiotics on the improvement of gut barrier parameters has been observed, but the results of human studies to date remain inconsistent. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of twelve-week supplementation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) with prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin (10 g per day) on the intestinal permeability in children with CD treated with a GFD. A pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled nutritional intervention was conducted in 34 children with CD, being on a strict GFD. Sugar absorption test (SAT) and the concentrations of intestinal permeability markers, such as zonulin, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, claudin-3, calprotectin, and glucagon-like peptide-2, were measured. We found that the supplementation with prebiotic did not have a substantial effect on barrier integrity. Prebiotic intake increased excretion of mannitol, which may suggest an increase in the epithelial surface. Most children in our study seem to have normal values for intestinal permeability tests before the intervention. For individuals with elevated values, improvement in calprotectin and SAT was observed after the prebiotic intake. This preliminary study suggests that prebiotics may have an impact on the intestinal barrier, but it requires confirmation in studies with more subjects with ongoing leaky gut.",

        "Abstract": "Peptides from several plant food proteins not only maintain the nutritional values of the original protein and decrease the environmental impact of animal agriculture, but also exert biological activities with significant health-beneficial effects. Wheat is the most important food grain source in the world. However, negative attention on wheat-based products has arose due to the role of gluten in celiac disease. A controlled enzymatic hydrolysis could reduce the antigenicity of wheat gluten protein hydrolysates (WGPHs). Therefore, the aims of the present study were to evaluate the effects of the in vitro administration of Alcalase-generated WGPHs on the immunological and antioxidant responses of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 39 healthy subjects. WGPH treatment reduced cell proliferation and the production of the Type 1 T helper (Th1) and Th17 pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17, respectively. WPGHs also improved the cellular anti-inflammatory microenvironment, increasing Th2/Th1 and Th2/Th17 balances. Additionally, WGPHs improved global antioxidant capacity, increased levels of the reduced form of glutathione and reduced nitric oxide production. These findings, not previously reported, highlight the beneficial capacity of these vegetable protein hydrolysates, which might represent an effective alternative in functional food generation.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is a gastrointestinal disorder whose genetic basis is not fully understood. Therefore, we studied a Saudi family with two CD affected siblings to discover the causal genetic defect. Through whole exome sequencing (WES), we identified that both siblings have inherited an extremely rare and deleterious <i>CPED1</i> genetic variant (c.241 A\u00a0>\u00a0G; p.Thr81Ala) segregating as autosomal recessive mutation, suggesting its putative causal role in the CD. Saudi population specific minor allele frequency (MAF) analysis has confirmed its extremely rare prevalence in homozygous condition (MAF is 0.0004). The Sanger sequencing analysis confirmed the absence of this homozygous variant in 100 sporadic Saudi CD cases. Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data has revealed that <i>CPED1</i> is abundantly expressed in gastrointestinal mucosa. By using a combination of systems biology approaches like protein 3D modeling, stability analysis and nucleotide sequence conservation analysis, we have further established that this variant is deleterious to the structural and functional aspects of <i>CPED1</i> protein. To the best of our knowledge, this variant has not been previously reported in CD or any other gastrointestinal disease. The cell culture and animal model studies could provide further insight into the exact role of <i>CPED1</i> p.Thr81Ala variant in the pathophysiology of CD. In conclusion, by using WES and systems biology analysis, present study for the first-time reports <i>CPED1</i> as a potential causative gene for CD in a Saudi family with potential implications to both disease diagnosis and genetic counseling.",

Phage display technology enabled the selection of affinity probes by successive rounds of biopanning against a biotinylated synthetic peptide comprising repetitive immunogenic gluten motifs. The analysis of a wide representation of heterologous plant species corroborated that two of the isolated clones were specific to wheat, barley and rye proteins. The phage antibody selected as the most appropriate clone for the detection of gluten in foods (dAb8E-phage) was further applied in an indirect ELISA to the analysis of 50 commercial food samples. Although the limit of detection achieved did not improve those of current immunoassays, the proposed methodology could provide promising new pathways for the generation of recombinant antibodies that allow a comprehensive determination of gluten in foods, whilst replacing the need for animal immunization.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease could be treated, and potentially cured, by restoring T-cell tolerance to gliadin. We investigated the safety and efficacy of negatively charged 500-nm poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles encapsulating gliadin protein (TIMP-GLIA) in 3 mouse models of celiac disease. Uptake of these nanoparticles by antigen-presenting cells was shown to induce immune tolerance in other animal models of autoimmune disease. We performed studies with C57BL/6; RAG1<sup>-/-</sup> (C57BL/6); and HLA-DQ8, huCD4 transgenic Ab0 NOD mice. Mice were given 1 or 2 tail-vein injections of TIMP-GLIA or control nanoparticles. Some mice were given intradermal injections of gliadin in complete Freund's adjuvant (immunization) or of soluble gliadin or ovalbumin (ear challenge). RAG<sup>-/-</sup> mice were given intraperitoneal injections of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>-</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells from gliadin-immunized C57BL/6 mice and were fed with an AIN-76A-based diet containing wheat gluten (oral challenge) or without gluten. Spleen or lymph node cells were analyzed in proliferation and cytokine secretion assays or by flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, or real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Serum samples were analyzed by gliadin antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and intestinal tissues were analyzed by histology. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or immature dendritic cells derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, were cultured in medium containing TIMP-GLIA, anti-CD3 antibody, or lipopolysaccharide (controls) and analyzed in proliferation and cytokine secretion assays or by flow cytometry. Whole blood or plasma from healthy volunteers was incubated with TIMP-GLIA, and hemolysis, platelet activation and aggregation, and complement activation or coagulation were analyzed. TIMP-GLIA did not increase markers of maturation on cultured human dendritic cells or induce activation of T cells from patients with active or treated celiac disease. In the delayed-type hypersensitivity (model 1), the HLA-DQ8 transgenic (model 2), and the gliadin memory T-cell enteropathy (model 3) models of celiac disease, intravenous injections of TIMP-GLIA significantly decreased gliadin-specific T-cell proliferation (in models 1 and 2), inflammatory cytokine secretion (in models 1, 2, and 3), circulating gliadin-specific IgG/IgG2c (in models 1 and 2), ear swelling (in model 1), gluten-dependent enteropathy (in model 3), and body weight loss (in model 3). In model 1, the effects were shown to be dose dependent. Splenocytes from HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice given TIMP-GLIA nanoparticles, but not control nanoparticles, had increased levels of FOXP3 and gene expression signatures associated with tolerance induction. In mice with gliadin sensitivity, injection of TIMP-GLIA nanoparticles induced unresponsiveness to gliadin and reduced markers of inflammation and enteropathy. This strategy might be developed for the treatment of celiac disease.",

        "Abstract": "Although ancient, heritage, and modern wheat varieties appear rather similar from a nutritional point of view, having a similar gluten content and a comparable toxicity linked to their undigested gluten peptide, whenever the role of ancient end heritage wheat grains has been investigated in animal studies or in clinical trials, more anti-inflammatory effects have been associated with the older wheat varieties. This review provides a critical overview of existing data on the differential physiological responses that could be elicited in the human body by ancient and heritage grains compared to modern ones. The methodology used was that of analyzing the results of relevant studies conducted from 2010 through PubMed search, by using as keywords \"ancient or heritage wheat\", \"immune wheat\" (protein or peptides), and immune gluten (protein or peptides). Our conclusion is that, even if we do not know exactly which molecular mechanisms are involved, ancient and heritage wheat varieties have different anti-inflammatory and antioxidant proprieties with respect to modern cultivars. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the health proprieties attributed to older cultivars could be related to wheat components which have positive roles in the modulation of intestinal inflammation and/or permeability.",

        "Abstract": "After a golden age of classic carnitine research three decades ago, the spread of mass spectrometry opened new perspectives and a much better understanding of the carnitine system is available nowadays. In the classic period, several human and animal studies were focused on various distinct physiological functions of this molecule and these revealed different aspects of carnitine homeostasis in normal and pathological conditions. Initially, the laboratory analyses were based on the classic or radioenzymatic assays, enabling only the determination of free and total carnitine levels and calculation of total carnitine esters' amount without any information on the composition of the acyl groups. The introduction of mass spectrometry allowed the measurement of free carnitine along with the specific and sensitive determination of different carnitine esters. Beyond basic research, mass spectrometry study of carnitine esters was introduced into the newborn screening program because of being capable to detect more than 30 metabolic disorders simultaneously. Furthermore, mass spectrometry measurements were performed to investigate different disease states affecting carnitine homeostasis, such as diabetes, chronic renal failure, celiac disease, cardiovascular diseases, autism spectrum disorder or inflammatory bowel diseases. This article will review the recent advances in the field of carnitine research with respect to mass spectrometric analyses of acyl-carnitines in normal and various pathological states. The growing number of publications using mass spectrometry as a tool to investigate normal physiological conditions or reveal potential biomarkers of primary and secondary carnitine deficiencies shows that this tool brought a new perspective to carnitine research.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CeD) is a highly prevalent chronic immune-mediated enteropathy developed in genetically predisposed individuals after ingestion of a group of wheat proteins (called gliadins and glutenins). The 13mer \u03b1-gliadin peptide, p31-43, induces proinflammatory responses, observed by in\u00a0vitro assays and animal models, that may contribute to innate immune mechanisms of CeD pathogenesis. Since a cellular receptor for p31-43 has not been identified, this raises the question of whether this peptide could mediate different biological effects. In this work, we aimed to characterize the p31-43 secondary structure by different biophysical and in\u00a0silico techniques. By dynamic light scattering and using an oligomer/fibril-sensitive fluorescent probe, we showed the presence of oligomers of this peptide in solution. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy analysis showed p31-43 oligomers with different height distribution. Also, peptide concentration had a very strong influence on peptide self-organization process. Oligomers gradually increased their size at lower concentration. Whereas, at higher ones, oligomers increased their complexity, forming branched structures. By CD, we observed that p31-43 self-organized in a polyproline II conformation in equilibrium with \u03b2-sheets-like structures, whose pH remained stable in the range of 3-8. In addition, these findings were supported by molecular dynamics simulation. The formation of p31-43 nanostructures with increased \u03b2-sheet structure may help to explain the molecular etiopathogenesis in the induction of proinflammatory effects and subsequent damage at the intestinal mucosa in CeD.",

        "Abstract": "The relatively common co-occurrence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD) suggests these disorders share common pathogenic etiologies. T1D and CD are strongly linked to closely related high-risk human lymphocyte antigens (HLA-DR-DQ). High-risk HLA molecules bind specific fragments of gluten or the islet self-antigen(s) and present these antigens to antigen-responsive T cells. In an appropriate proinflammatory environment, the autoimmune response results in destruction of the intestinal enterocyte and/or the pancreatic beta cell. Environmental factors have been implicated in the etiology of T1D and CD because (1) identical twins are only partially concordant for these disorders and (2) incidence rates of T1D and CD have been steadily rising for decades. Prospective studies in infants genetically predisposed to T1D and CD showed that antibody positivity to both disorders begins in the first 1-3 years of life. Viral infections and early exposure to gluten or cow's milk in the infant diet have been implicated in disease pathogenesis. However, delaying introduction of gluten in the infant diet until 12 months of age had no impact on the development of islet or celiac autoimmunity. Weaning nursing infants to hydrolyzed infant formula had no impact on the development of T1D. Viral infections have been suspected of playing a role in T1D pathogenesis for decades. A large international prospective study (TEDDY) has shown increased risk of T1D autoimmunity particularly when >5 respiratory infections or febrile infections have occurred in the 9 months preceding the appearance of islet antibodies. Provocative data in animal models of T1D suggest the microbiome may play an important role in the pathogenesis of T1D. Breastfeeding, diet, infections, antibiotics, and method of birth alter the composition of the microbiome. Human data indicate subtle differences in the microbiome of children with T1D autoimmunity, while intestinal dysbiosis has been clearly demonstrated in CD. Alterations of the integrity of the intestinal mucosa plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CD, and the NOD mouse model suggests an important role of a leaky intestinal epithelium in T1D as well. Key Message: Immunogenetics and the environment are closely interrelated in the pathogenesis of T1D and CD. Large well-designed prospective studies in at-risk populations informed by scientifically rigorous studies in animal models are likely to have the greatest impact on our understanding of the complex pathogenesis of these detrimental autoimmune disorders.",

        "Title": "Viruses and Autoimmunity: A Review on the Potential Interaction and Molecular Mechanisms.",
        "Abstract": "For a long time, viruses have been shown to modify the clinical picture of several autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (SS), herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK), celiac disease (CD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Best examples of viral infections that have been proposed to modulate the induction and development of autoimmune diseases are the infections with enteric viruses such as Coxsackie B virus (CVB) and rotavirus, as well as influenza A viruses (IAV), and herpesviruses. Other viruses that have been studied in this context include, measles, mumps, and rubella. Epidemiological studies in humans and experimental studies in animal have shown that viral infections can induce or protect from autoimmunopathologies depending on several factors including genetic background, host-elicited immune responses, type of virus strain, viral load, and the onset time of infection. Still, data delineating the clear mechanistic interaction between the virus and the immune system to induce autoreactivity are scarce. Available data indicate that viral-induced autoimmunity can be activated through multiple mechanisms including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, bystander activation, and immortalization of infected B cells. Contrarily, the protective effects can be achieved via regulatory immune responses which lead to the suppression of autoimmune phenomena. Therefore, a better understanding of the immune-related molecular processes in virus-induced autoimmunity is warranted. Here we provide an overview of the current understanding of viral-induced autoimmunity and the mechanisms that are associated with this phenomenon.",

        "Title": "Celiac disease: should we care about microbes?",
        "Abstract": "The prevalence of celiac disease (CeD) has increased in the last decades, suggesting a role for environmental factors in addition to gluten. Several cohort studies have shown that different gastrointestinal infections increase CeD risk. However, the mechanisms by which microbes participate in CeD have remained elusive. Recently, with the use of animal models, both viral and bacterial opportunistic pathogens were shown to induce immune activation relevant for CeD. The hypothesis that viral and/or bacterial infections can contribute to immune activation and breakdown of tolerance toward gluten in genetically susceptible individuals is therefore reinforced. Here, we discuss the evidence regarding the role of microbes in promoting CeD and the specific pathways triggered by microbes that could participate in CeD pathogenesis. Understanding these pathways will allow us to develop optimal microbiota-modulating strategies to help prevent CeD.",

        "Abstract": "Targeted degrading Aspergillus niger-derived prolyl endopeptidase (AN-PEP) is promising in gluten hydrolysis because it specifically cleaves the proline-rich sites in gluten. The current study aims to understand the safety aspects of AN-PEP hydrolysed low immunoreactive wheat flours by testing immune responses using cell line and animal models. In the AN-PEP hydrolysed wheat flour (AN-PEP HWF) gliadin extract, there was no increase in the levels of zonulin-1 (Zo-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) but a significant increase was noted in the control wheat flour (CWF) gliadin-treated Caco-2\u202fcells. The Zo-1 localization in Caco-2\u202fcells was significantly noted in the reacted positive fluorescence cells that were treated with the control wheat flour. Further, a safety evaluation of HWF was carried out in gluten-sensitized BALB/c mice. Mouse anti-gliadin (IgG, IgA and IgE) antibodies were significantly generated in the CWF treated animals rather than the AN-PEP HWF groups. The serum pro-inflammatory (IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-15, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3) markers were observed in significant levels in CWF challenged mice and a similar trend was observed in ex-vivo splenocyte cells. A small intestine histopathological sectioning revealed that there are no abnormalities or structural changes in AN-PEP HWF challenged mice.",

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of wheat allergy has reached significant levels in many countries. Therefore, wheat is a major global food safety and public health issue. Animal models serve as critical tools to advance the understanding of the mechanisms of wheat allergenicity to develop preventive and control methods. A comprehensive review on the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity using animal models is unavailable at present. There were two major objectives of this study: To identify the lessons that animal models have taught us regarding the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity and to identify the strengths, challenges, and future prospects of animal models in basic and applied wheat allergy research. Using the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, we retrieved and critically analyzed the relevant articles and excluded celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Our analysis shows that animal models can provide insight into the IgE epitope structure of wheat allergens, effects of detergents and other chemicals on wheat allergenicity, and the role of genetics, microbiome, and food processing in wheat allergy. Although animal models have inherent limitations, they are critical to advance knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity. They can also serve as highly useful pre-clinical testing tools to develop safer genetically modified wheat, hypoallergenic wheat products, novel pharmaceuticals, and vaccines.",

The secondary objective was to evaluate metabolic (C-peptide, glycemia) and inflammatory (lactate and platelet levels) parameters after diabetes induction by total pancreatectomy and pancreatic allotransplant after total pancreatectomy. The study protocol was approved by the French Minister of Research (APAFiS no.18169). Insulin-dependent diabetes was induced by total pancreatectomy in one male Sus scrofa pig, and pancreatic allotransplant was performed, after total pancreatectomy, in 3 male Sus scrofa pigs. Total pancreatectomy was performed under general anesthesia,with meticulous dissection of the portal vein and the splenic vein to preserve the spleen. Concerning pancreas procurement, extensive pancreas preparation occurred during thewarm phase,before coldperfusion. Pancreatic allotransplant was performed using donor aorta (with superior mesenteric artery and celiac trunk). Diabetes induction was successful, with negative C-peptide values at 3 hours after total pancreatectomy. Glycemic control without hypoglycemic events was obtained with the use of long-acting insulin administered once per day. No rapid-acting insulin was used. In animals that received pancreatic allotransplant, after enteral feeding was started, glycemic control without hypoglycemic events and without insulin was obtained in 2 animals. In an experimental porcine model, diabetes induction by total pancreatectomy and pancreatic allotransplant after total pancreatectomy are feasible and effective. The development of these models offers the potential for new investigations into ischemia-reperfusion injuries, improvement of pancreas procurement methods, and preservation techniques.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac ganglia are important sites of signal integration and transduction. Their complex neurochemical anatomy has been studied extensively in guinea pigs but not in mice. The goal of this study was to provide detailed neurochemical characterization of mouse celiac ganglia and noradrenergic nerves in two target tissues, spleen and stomach. A vast majority of mouse celiac neurons express a noradrenergic phenotype, which includes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), vesicular monoamine transporter 2, and the norepinephrine transporter. Over 80% of these neuron also express neuropeptide Y (NPY), and this coexpression is maintained by dissociated neurons in culture. Likewise, TH and NPY were colocalized in noradrenergic nerves throughout the spleen and in stomach blood vessels. Somatostatin was not detected in principal neurons but did occur in small, TH-negative cells presumed to be interneurons and in a few varicose nerve fibers. Cholinergic nerves provided the most abundant input to the ganglia, and small percentages of these also contained nitric oxide synthase or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. A low-to-moderate density of nerves also stained separately for the latter markers. Additionally, nerve bundles and varicose nerve fibers containing the sensory neuropeptides, calcitonin gene-related polypeptide, and substance P, occurred at variable density throughout the ganglia. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that principal neurons of mouse celiac ganglia have less neurochemical diversity than reported for guinea pig and other species but receive input from nerves expressing an array of neurochemical markers. This profile suggests celiac neurons integrate input from many sources to influence target tissues by releasing primarily norepinephrine and NPY.",

The aim of this study was to establish an experimental intraperitoneal infection model for H. parasuis in neutropenic guinea pigs. Intraperitoneal administration of cyclophosphamide and Haemophilus parasuis was conducted in guinea pigs. Clinical signs, gross pathology, and histopathology were observed in neutropenic guinea pigs infected with H. parasuis. Intraperitoneal administration of 100\u202fmg/kg cyclophosphamide led to immunosuppression with white blood cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils all <1000\u202fmm<sup>3</sup>, while no histological tissue damage was observed. Intraperitoneal administration of 10<sup>9</sup> colony-forming units (CFU) of H. parasuis led to typical respiratory symptoms, 90% morbidity, and 20% mortality in a 72\u202fh-period. Bacteriological screening revealed that multiple organs, including the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, and blood, were infected with H. parasuis. The threshold loads of bacteria in blood and the lungs were (7.04\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.53)log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL and (6.24\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.62)log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g, respectively, at 3 d after infection. Gross pathology examination showed celiac effusion, intestinal mucosal hemorrhage, and liver, spleen, or lung swelling, necrosis, and hemorrhage. Congestion, mild interstitial pneumonia, inflammatory exudation, and endothelial cell proliferation were observed in the histological examination. All the results suggest that we have established an experimental intraperitoneal infection model for H. parasuis in neutropenic guinea pigs. It is especially useful as a tool for pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or a pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model of antimicrobial agents against respiratory disease.",

        "Abstract": "Gene therapy offers the possibility to treat pancreatic disease in cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene; however, gene transfer to the pancreas is untested in humans. The pancreatic disease phenotype is very similar between humans and pigs with CF; thus, CF pigs create an excellent opportunity to study gene transfer to the pancreas. There are no studies showing efficient transduction of pig pancreas with gene-transfer vectors. Our objective is to develop a safe and efficient method to transduce wild-type (WT) porcine pancreatic ducts that express CFTR. We catheterized the umbilical artery of WT newborn pigs and delivered an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vector expressing green-fluorescent protein (AAV9CMV.sceGFP) or vehicle to the celiac artery, the vessel that supplies major branches to the pancreas. This technique resulted in stable and dose-dependent transduction of pancreatic duct epithelial cells that expressed CFTR. Intravenous (IV) injection of AAV9CMV.sceGFP did not transduce the pancreas. Our technique offers an opportunity to deliver the CFTR gene to the pancreas of CF pigs. The celiac artery can be accessed via the umbilical artery in newborns and via the femoral artery at older ages--delivery approaches that can be translated to humans.",

        "Abstract": "The stent graft is a noncompliant system inserted in a semi-compliant structure. This generates a mismatch. The media also shows a composite movement and is oriented 45\u00b0 resulting in an arterial spiral movement that contributes to maintaining the clockwise orientation of laminar flow with an 80\u00b0 deflection. Our multilayer stent is constituted by a single Nitinol thread, worked on 3 surfaces in order to realize a proper exoskeleton that reproduces the architecture of the tunica media, in particular its flexo-torsional forces, thus restoring the energy transmission and the match between the wall and the blood flow. A first in vivo implantation was performed by using an experimental pig model in our veterinary department. The pig underwent general anesthesia and the right femoral artery was surgically exposed in order to accommodate a 12F long introducer sheath. Under fluoroscopy three multilayer stents were consecutively implanted from the aortic isthmus to the iliac bifurcation in an overlap fashion. All the intercostal artery and visceral branches were covered by the overlapped stents. The final control angiography revealed an optimal sealing of the implanted stent with an evident flexotorsional oscillatory movement, which follows the conical architecture of the thoracic aorta and the complete patency of all the branches that arise from the aorta. After two months, the multilayer showed a normal endothelialization process with an optimal adhesion to the aortic wall both proximally and distally without provoking any inflammatory response or thickness wall alterations. The perfect and homogenous endothelialization preserved the patency of all the collateral branches arising from the treated aorta, in particular all the intercostal arteries, celiac trunk, and renal arteries. The disease of the aorta essentially concerns the tunica media as it causes disruption of the media components. This exoskeleton works like a neo-tunica media, is perfectly endothelialized, and seems to optimally transmit the flexotorsional forces, restoring the match between wall and flow that represents the primary condition for laminar flow and branch perfusion.",

To investigate the potential role of gluten in equine ISBD. Antibodies known to be important in the diagnosis of human coeliac disease (CD): IgA antibodies to human recombinant and guinea pig tissue-transglutaminase (TGA), native gliadin (AGA), deamidated-gliadin-peptides (DGPA), and primate and equine endomysium (EMA) were assessed in blood samples from three different groups of horses: ISBD affected (n\u2009=\u200912) on a gluten-rich diet and controls either on gluten-rich (n\u2009=\u200922) or gluten-poor (n\u2009=\u200925) diets. Significant differences (p\u2009<\u20090.05) between groups were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. Both ISBD-affected horses and gluten-rich controls had significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.0004) higher hrTGA titers than gluten-poor controls. However, ISBD horses did not show significantly increased levels of any of the CD related antibodies when compared to gluten-rich controls. Nevertheless, markedly increased antibody levels (TGA, EMA and DGPA) were found in one of the ISBD horses. The introduction of a gluten-free ration in this 14-year-old warmblood stallion resulted after 6 months in the reduction of antibody levels and clinical recovery associated with improved duodenal histopathology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing gluten-related antibodies in horses and results suggest a potential pathogenic role of gluten in at least some cases of equine ISBD. Clinical importance and impact for human medicine: Given serology and concurrent clinical findings, this study warrants further investigations into the immunologic basis of possible gluten-sensitive enteropathy in horses and analogy with human disease.",

        "Abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disorder affecting genetically predisposed subjects. It is caused by the ingestion of wheat gluten and related prolamins. A final diagnosis for this disease can be obtained by examination of jejunal biopsies. Nevertheless, different analytical approaches have been established to detect the presence of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies that represent a serological hallmark of the disease. In this work, we explored a new method for the diagnosis of CD based on the detection of serum anti-transglutaminase antibodies by resonance energy transfer (RET) between donor molecules and acceptor molecules. In particular, we labeled the liver transglutaminase (tTG) enzyme from guinea pig and the rabbit anti-tTG antibodies with a couple of fluorescence probes that are able to make RET if they are located within with F\u00f6rster distance. We labeled tTG with the fluorescence probe DyLight 594 as donor and the anti-tTG antibodies with the fluorescence probe DyLight 649 as acceptor. However, due to the large size of the formed complex (tTG/anti-tTG), and consequently to the low efficiency energy transfer process between the donor-acceptor molecules, we explored a new experimental approach that allows us to extend the utilizable range of RET between donor:acceptor pairs by using one single molecule as donor and multiple molecules as energy acceptors, instead of using a single acceptor molecule as usually occurs in RET experiments. The obtained results clearly show that the use of one donor and multiacceptor strategy enables for a simple and rapid detection of serum anti-transglutaminase antibodies. In addition, our results point out that it is possible to consider this approach as a new method for a wide variety of analytical assays.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of two INOVA ELISA kits to detect IgA anti-htTGA and anti-gptTGA in patients with and without CD. The study groups were comprised of 49 anti-endomysial antibody (EMA)-positive untreated-CD, and 123 controls (EMA-negative treated CD, EMA-negative chronic diarrhea, autoimmune hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease and healthy people). The agreement between the two ELISAs was statistically significant in all study groups and there was no significant difference between them (92.7% agreement; kappa = 0.70; kappa p = 0.001; McNemar p = 1). All patients with serum reactivity of more than 100 units had histologic diagnosis of CD. In seven of 10 patients with treated-CD who had control biopsies, villous atrophy was still present in four who tested positive by both kits. Two of three celiacs with histologic remission tested positive for both anti-tTGA. the anti-gptTGA and anti-htTGA determination were equally efficient in identifying patients with untreated-CD with high titers of EMA. Whatever the anti-tTGA ELISA used, the reactivity above 100 units was always related to active CD diagnosed by histologic alterations in intestinal biopsies. The anti-tTGA reactivity by both kits was not only similar in determining histologic activity in the follow-up of CD after a gluten free diet, but also in identifying positive sera from the control groups, regardless if CD has been confirmed by duodenal biopsies.",

        "Abstract": "Activation of small intestinal gluten-reactive CD4(+) T-cells is a critical event in celiac disease. Deamidation of specific glutamine residues by tissue transglutaminase enhances the binding of T-cell activating gliadin epitopes to DQ2, increasing T-cell recognition. Our purpose was to investigate whether deamidated gliadin epitopes can be generated in the small intestinal mucosa by tissue transglutaminase and to characterize the location of the process. Intestinal explants from pig intestine and frozen biopsy slices from human and rat intestine were incubated with alpha-gliadin peptides containing the immunodominant motif. Monoclonal antibodies specifically recognizing the non-deamidated and/or the deamidated epitope were used for immunofluorescence studies. We conclude that endogenous tissue transglutaminase can mediate extracellular deamidation of gliadin peptides in the lamina propria. Gliadin peptides with more than one recognition site can be simultaneously cross-linked and deamidated extracellularly in the lamina propria, and might be of importance for the antibody response seen in untreated celiac disease patients.",

The opposite (appearance of autoimmunity) has also been reported. The aim of this study was to describe the pattern of these immune markers in patients with lymphoid malignancies. Sera from 96 patients with NHL (median age 72, range 38-88, F/M 41/55) were analysed with ELISA to determine the frequency of antibodies against guinea pig (gp) and human recombinant (hr) transglutaminase type 2 (Tg2), and hr factor XIII subunit a* (part of the Tg-family), extractable nuclear antigen (ENA), and hp. As hp antibodies decrease in younger age cohorts a sex- and age-matched control group of 768 persons was used. The control population for transglutaminase antibodies consisted of 59 blood donors, (median 42 years, range 19-65) was analysed with a commercial kit. Gp-Tg2-IgG positivity was documented in 72% and hr-Tg2-IgG positivity in 15% (5% positive controls for both; P < 0.001 and ns, respectively). For IgA 3% had gp-Tg2 and 4% hr-Tg2 (5% in controls: ns for both). Anti-FXIII-IgA positivity was found in 22% (5% in controls; P = 0.03). Unspecific anti-ENA-IgG positivity was found in 24% (P < 0.001), while only 2% had specific ENA autoantibodies. Moreover, 36% were positive for anti-hp-IgG, while controls were positive in 54% (P < 0.001). The frequency of unspecific autoantibodies was increased. No differences could be noted in specific autoantibodies (hr-Tg2-IgA). In contrast, fewer than expected were anti-hp-positive. A defective immune response, similar to that in autoimmune diseases, could contribute to the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies.",

        "Abstract": "Aetiopathogenesis of psoriasis is complex and not yet well known. In recent years, it has been observed that psoriasis can coexist with clinically asymptomatic celiac disease and a gluten-free diet helps to obtain remission, even in patients with very chronic lesions. The aim of our work was to investigate how often the positive titres of antibodies characteristic for celiac disease occur in psoriatics' serum in exacerbation in comparison with controls. Serum samples from 67 patients with intensified psoriatic lesions were investigated. Serum from healthy people at a comparable age and with no familial predisposition to psoriasis and celiac disease was the control material. Antibodies against human tissue transglutaminase (recombinant antigen), against tissue transglutaminase isolated from guinea pig's liver and against gliadin were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Anti-endomysial antibodies were determined by indirect immunofluorescence method. Patients with psoriasis have significantly higher mean concentrations of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (human recombinant and guinea pig-derived antigen) and against gliadin for IgA. IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (both antigens) and gliadin positively correlate with psoriasis activity. No anti-endomysial antibodies for IgA were found in any serum. Our results seem to imply an association between psoriasis and asymptomatic celiac disease/gluten intolerance. High percentage of positive results to guinea pig-derived tTG could be due to cellular activity of tissue transglutaminase in psoriasis.",

Over a period of 3 years, 333 children (<or=14 y of age) with suspected CD were evaluated. CD was diagnosed on the basis of modified ESPGHAN criteria. Antibody to tTG (guinea-pig) was detected by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Children with a suspicion of CD but found to have normal villous architecture were taken as controls. Antiendomysial antibody (EMA) and IgA-antigliadin antibody were done in 80 cases and 40 controls. The mean age of 180 children with CD was 6.5+/-3 years with a male to female ratio of 1.7:1. Their presenting complaints were diarrhea in 84% and failure to thrive in 87%. Wasting, stunting, and anemia were seen in 87%, 59%, and 83% of cases, respectively. The best sensitivity and specificity of tTG antibody we have got at a cut-off value of 10 U/mL and were 94% and 97%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 98% and negative predictive value of 92.4%. The mean tTG antibody titer was 106+/-76 U/mL in cases and 2+/-1.6 U/mL in controls (P<0.001). The concordance of tTG antibody with EMA was 95% in cases and 97.5% in controls. tTG antibody is a highly sensitive and specific serologic marker. Being technically simpler and due to its high concordance with EMA, it can be used as an alternative to EMA in developing countries like India.",

To verify if the positive results for anti-tTG autoantibody are false positives due to cross reactivity with mitochondrial antigens, we studied 105 adult patients affected with PBC, positive for anti-mitochondrial M2 antibodies. Anti-tTG IgA antibodies were studied by using six different immunoenzymatic assays that employ the tTG antigen obtained from different sources (human recombinant, placenta, red blood cells, and guinea pig liver). On the whole, 28 out of 105 PBC subjects tested positive for anti-tTG IgA antibodies, but only two were eventually found to be affected by CD; the other 26 were shown to be false positive. The specificity of the various antigenic substrates ranged from 88.5% of the human erythrocytes tTG to 97.1% of the human recombinant tTG. The results of this study showed that a true association between PBC and CD was present in only 2% of the patients and that, in most cases, the false positive results were attributable to the type of substrate utilized in the assay.",

        "Abstract": "With the appreciation of the high prevalence of coeliac disease there is increasing use of serology in screening asymptomatic people and testing those with suggestive features. To compare the sensitivities and specificities of the endomysial antibody and the tissue transglutaminase antibody tests. Using electronic databases a search was made for relevant papers using the terms tissue transglutaminase and endomysial antibody. Both the endomysial antibody and tissue transglutaminase antibody have very high sensitivities (93% for both) and specificities (>99% and >98% respectively) for the diagnosis of typical coeliac disease with villous atrophy. Human recombinant tissue transglutaminase performs much better than guinea pig tissue transglutaminase. Review of studies comparing endomysial antibody with human recombinant tissue transglutaminase antibody shows that endomysial antibody more often has a higher specificity and human recombinant tissue transglutaminase antibody more often has a higher sensitivity. The human recombinant tissue transglutaminase antibody is the preferred test for screening asymptomatic people and for excluding coeliac disease in symptomatic individuals with a low pretest probability (i.e. <25%) for coeliac disease. Furthermore, it has a number of practical and financial advantages. If the pretest probability is >25%, biopsy is preferred as the post-test probability of coeliac disease with a negative test is still >2%.",

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and G (IgG) type anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA), IgA type anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies (anti-tTG) with antigen of guinea pig and human source were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and endomysium antibodies (EMA) by indirect immunofluorescence test. HLA-DQA1*0501/DQB1*0201 (DQ2) was revealed by polymerase chain reaction. Celiac disease was diagnosed by revised ESPGHAN criteria. 41% of DS patients had AGA, 6.0% IgA anti-tTG with guinea pig antigen, and 3.0% IgA EMA (all positive for anti-tTG with human tTG). Subtotal villous atrophy was found in 5 out of 9 DS patients who had agreed to small bowel biopsy. One of them had DQA1*0501/DQB1*0201 and anti-tTG and EMA i.e. typical for CD markers (this case also fulfilled the ESPGHAN diagnostic criteria),but other four lacked these markers. Three non-biopsied DS patients had also most probably CD because DQA1*0501/DQB1*0201 and IgA anti-tTG (EMA) were detected. Thus, the prevalence of CD among our DS patients population is 3.0% (95 % of confidence interval [CI]: 0.1-5.9%). We confirm the increased frequency of CD among DS patients. In addition, we have revealed a subgroup of patients with subtotal villous atrophy but without characteristic for CD immunological and genetic markers. Whether these cases represent CD (with atypical immunopathogenesis) or some other immune enteropathy, requires further investigations.",

        "Abstract": "One of the most reliable sero-diagnostic tests for coeliac disease (CD) is the measurement, by ELISA, of serum IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) adsorbed to the wells of microtitre plates. In spite of its reliability, however, some discrepancies exist with the results obtained by the antiendomysium histological assay (EMA) and by biopsy the accepted gold standard. Among the reasons for these differences in titres between the ELISA and the last 2 mentioned assays are the conformational changes that proteins undergo on adsorption and the importance of conformational epitopes on tTG for diagnosing CD. To address this problem, a novel procedure was developed using guinea-pig tTG (gptTG) free in solution to interact with IgA antibodies in the sera of CD patients. Any immune complexes so formed are then captured by anti-tTG antibodies preadsorbed to the wells of microtitre plates. This immunocapture method was optimized for the amount of soluble gptTG needed to interact with all the IgA's anti-tTG present in fixed dilutions of serum samples, the amount of rabbit IgG anti-gptTG used to coat the wells of microtitre plates and the order of addition of the reaction components. Comparison of the IgA titres obtained by immunocapture with those by EMA and ELISA (adsorbed tTG) on 9 highly positive and 6 weakly positive sera from clinically characterized CD patients and 5 negative sera from non-CD control subjects revealed that the IgA titres by the immunocapture procedure were well correlated with those obtained by EMA, whereas the titres on ELISA showed discrepancies with both immunocapture and EMA.",

Another calcium-dependent cysteine enzyme, peptidylarginine deiminase type 4 (PAD4), seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There are obvious similarities between Tgs and PADs. Using enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assays, we have measured the occurrence of antibodies against guinea pig (gp) and human recombinant (hr) tTg, PAD and citrulline in 59 controls and 184 RA-patients, of whom 71 were treated with methotrexate (mtx). In addition to the expected antibodies against citrulline (62%), sera from the 113 RA-patients without mtx treatment contained significantly increased frequencies of IgG anti-PAD (35%), IgA anti-gp-tTg (34%), IgA anti-hr tTg (20%), IgG anti-gp-tTg (13%) and IgA anti-hr-FXIII (15%) compared to controls. In sera from the mtx-treated RA-patients the expression of antibodies was reduced. In patients not treated with methotrexate there was a statistically significant correlation between, on one hand, IgG anti-PAD and on the other hand, IgG anti-citrulline, IgA anti-gp-tTg, IgA anti-hr-tTg, IgG anti-gp-tTg, IgG anti-hr-tTg, or IgA anti-hr-FXIII. In the mtx-treated group these correlations were less pronounced. In addition to the expected antibodies against citrulline, sera from RA-patients contained antibodies against PAD and against Tgs of at least two kinds, indicating that the specificity for anti-tTg in CD is far from complete. Most of the patients displayed more than one antibody, a possible indication of epitope spreading. MTX-treatment reduced the expression of antibodies.",

Twenty-one studies, with untreated CD patients and healthy/CD-free controls, were included in the meta-analysis. The diagnostic accuracy was estimated using a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and pooled sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp). Multiple assays within a study were treated by considering all the assays within a study and by analyzing the most popular assay (i.e., the commercial anti-tTTG ELISA most frequently utilized in the papers in which multiple assays were included). The SROC curve indicated the absence of heterogeneity, and the superiority of recombinant human tTG (rh-tTG) and purified human tTG (ph-tTG) compared to guinea pig-tTG (gp-tTG). The sensitivities (most popular assay) for rh-tTG, ph-tTG, and gp-tTG were 94%, 90%, and 92%, respectively, and the specificities were 97%, 92%, and 96%, respectively. A sensitivity analysis (exclusion of studies with bias) altered the results of ph-tTG: Se, 95%; Sp, 98%. The sensitivities (all individual assays) for rh-tTG, ph-tTG, and gp-tTG were 94%, 94%, and 91%, respectively, and the specificities were 95%, 94%, and 89%, respectively. Human tTG ELISA is sensitive and specific, and it can be used for mass screening. Sensitivity analysis showed that ph-tTG might perform better.",

Rabbit reticulocytes displayed calcium-dependent tTG activity. Calcium increased binding of IgA-tTG and IgG-tTG in the ELISA test.

A weighted mean of the sensitivity and specificity along with 95% confidence intervals and summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated. The pooled specificity of endomyseal antibody (EMA)-monkey esophagus (ME) or EMA-human umbilical cord (HU) was close to 100% in adults and children. The pooled specificity of transglutaminase antibody (tTG)-guinea pig (GP) and tTG-human recombinant (HR) were between 95% and 99%. IgA-EMA-ME demonstrated sensitivities of 96% and 97% in children and adults, respectively. EMA-HU demonstrated a similar sensitivity of 97% in children but 90% in adults.

The performance of antigliadin antibody was inferior to that of EMA and tTG. EMA and tTG offer high sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity of these tests appears to be lower than reported when milder histologic grades are used to define CD (below 90%).

The positive predictive value of these tests is likely lower than reported when the tests are applied in low-prevalence populations.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue transglutaminase is the major autoantigen recognized in the sera of coeliac patients. An enzyme-linked immune-adsorbed assay based on tissue transglutaminase was recently used to measure serum tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulins A for coeliac disease diagnosis. To determine the sensitivity, the specificity, the positive and negative predictive values of an immunoenzymatic assay based on guinea pig tissue transglutaminase, to compare antititransglutaminase immunoenzymatic assay to the antiendomysium immunofluorescent assay, and to define a cost-effective sequence to execute serum antibody determination in coeliac patients. We assessed for coeliac disease antibodies 91 pediatric patients with symptoms suggestive of coeliac disease, and 23 patients with coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet as controls. Antitransglutaminase immunoglobulins A showed 93.1% sensitivity, 93.6% specificity, 87.1% positive and 96.7% negative predictive values. Antitransglutaminase immunoglobulins A were significantly higher in antiendomysium positive subjects. Correlation between antitransglutaminase immunoglobulins A and antigliadin immunoglobulins A was not significant. Our results show that antitransglutaminase immunoenzymatic assay represents a cost-effective strategy for patients' serological evaluation and it could substitute EMA determination, which could be considered a second level evaluation.",

The tests were performed by means of a few immunohistochemical methods in specimens from: gut, skin, the lungs, lymph nodes, the heart, the thymus, the spleen, skeletal muscles of control guinea pigs and from inflamed skeletal muscles and skin. TG2 expression was found in artery, vein and lymphatic vessel endothelia, in mesothelia of pleura, pericardium and peritoneum, and in smooth muscle cells. Spleen deserves a special attention, since this organ, especially rich in TG2, may be much more involved in celiac disease and in liver diseases than it has been accepted so far. The subject calls for further elucidation.",

        "Abstract": "Analysis of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG) has been shown valuable in the diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) but how quickly serum titres decrease after introduction of a gluten-free diet (GFD) is not known in adults. CD is a well-recognized disorder amongst the general population and many persons try a GFD for fairly vague symptoms before they seek medical advice. Therefore, it is important to determine the time that the serologic tests remain predictive of the disease after the introduction of a GFD. Sera were taken from 22 consecutively biopsy-proven adult patients with CD in connection with the diagnostic biopsy. The patients were followed for 1 year and sera were taken after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after start of a GFD. Sera were stored at -20 degrees C and analysed for IgA antibodies against gliadin, endomysium and two different commercial tTG assays based on recombinant human tTG (tTGrh) and guinea-pig liver (tTGgp). Twenty patients could be followed during GFD and all antibody titres fell sharply within 1 month after introduction of a GFD and continued to decline during the survey interval. Thirty days after beginning the diet only 58, 84, 74 and 53% of all patients had positive antibody levels of tTGrh, tTGgp, EmA and AGA respectively. As the antibodies used to confirm the diagnosis of CD fall rapidly and continue to decline following the introduction of a GFD, it is important that health care providers carefully inquire about the possibility of self-prescribed diets before patients sought medical attention.",

        "Abstract": "So far the reliability of the anti-guinea pig and anti-human tissue transglutaminase antibodies for the coeliac disease diagnosis has been evaluated in selected groups of patients. To compare the diagnostic accuracy of anti-human versus anti-guinea pig tissue transglutaminase in the coeliac disease screening of the general population. Two healthy Italian populations living in Marche region and in Western Sardinia. Both anti-guinea pig and anti-human tissue transglutaminase were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based commercially available kit (Eu-tTG, Eurospital, Trieste, Italy). During the period 1999-2001, 3541 subjects (1500 from \"continental\" Italy and 2041 from Sardinia) were screened for coeliac disease using both anti-guinea pig and anti-human tissue transglutaminase as first-level tests. Both these tests were negative in 3439/3541 sera, while 29 resulted positive for both of them and 73 showed discordant results. Overall, 50 intestinal biopsies were performed in 22, 21 and 7 subjects with positivity to both screening tests, to anti-guinea pig and to anti-human tissue transglutaminase alone, respectively. A coeliac disease diagnosis was made in 25 subjects giving an overall prevalence of 1:126 individuals. The anti-tissue transglutaminase specificity and sensitivity were 98 and 92% for guinea pig and 99.6 and 96% for human tissue transglutaminase, respectively. The anti-human tissue transglutaminase test should definitely replace the anti-guinea pig-derived one as first-level screening tool for identifying all subjects who need the second-level investigations (small intestinal biopsy).",

        "Title": "The role of the immune response against tissue transglutaminase in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease.",
        "Abstract": "The development of autoimmunity to tissue transglutaminase (TGase 2) is a striking feature of coeliac disease, an enteropathy that develops in genetically susceptible individuals upon exposure to dietary gluten. IgA anti-TGase 2 autoantibodies are present in at least 98% of coeliac patients on a gluten-containing diet and provide a valuable tool for the diagnosis of the disorder. During disease development, the formation of TGase 2-gliadin complexes through TGase 2 activity appears to be central for B-cell epitope spreading from gliadin to TGase 2. However, the potential role of an immune response against TGase 2 in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease and for the development of the intestinal lesion remains unclear. Recently, an inhibitory effect of anti-TGase 2 autoantibodies from coeliac patients on TGase 2 activity in vitro has been described. Here, we report that a cellular and humoral response against TGase 2 can be induced in TGase 2 (-/-) and wildtype mice on a C57BL/6 background by s.c. immunization with human recombinant or guinea pig TGase 2 in complete Freund's adjuvant. Immunized wildtype, but not TGase 2 (-/-) mice develop periductal lymphocytic infiltrates in lacrimal glands. Although no intestinal lesions were found, this observation lends support to the concept that the development of autoimmunity against TGase 2 is a pathological event that might ultimately lead to organ damage.",

        "Abstract": "Screening for celiac disease is based on the sequential evaluation of serologic tests and intestinal biopsy; an optimal screening protocol is still under investigation. The screening policy of one of the main healthcare providers in Israel (Maccabi) consists of measuring total immunoglobulin A and tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies and confirming positive results by endomysial antibodies. For IgA-deficient patients antigliadin IgG is measured. To evaluate the use of tTGA as a first-level screening test in patients suspected of having celiac disease The results of tTGA and EMA tests over a 3 month period were obtained from the laboratory computer. Letters were sent to the referring physicians of patients with positive tests, requesting clinical information and small intestinal biopsy results. tTGA was performed using an anti-guinea pig tTG-IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Overall, 2,505 tTGA tests were performed: 216 (8.6%) were tTGA-positive of which 162 (75%) were EMA-negative (group 1) and 54 (25%) EMA-positive (group 2.) Clinical information was obtained for 91 patients in group 1 and 32 in group 2. Small intestinal biopsy was performed in 33 (36%) and 27 patients (84%) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Celiac disease was diagnosed in 4 biopsies (12%) in group 1 and 23 (85%) in group 2 (P < 0.0001). The positive predictive value was 45% for tTGA and 85% for EMA. Symptomatic patients with positive tTGA and negative EMA have a low rate of celiac disease compared to those who are tTGA-positive and EMA-positive. Confirmation with EMA is advised when tTGA is performed as a first-level screening for suspected celiac disease.",

However, a high rate of false positives in autoantibody testing was noted, especially when tissue transglutaminase (tTG) from guinea pig liver was used. Thus, the real prevalence of CD in CTD, IBD, and PBC is unclear. In a case-control study, 400 patients with CTD, 170 with IBD, 48 with PBC, and 120 healthy subjects were investigated for CD by the analysis of IgA and IgG tTG antibodies using the more specific human recombinant tTG immunoenzymatic assay. Patients and controls with positive findings were further tested for antiendomysial antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence and HLA typing, and those found positive by either of these tests underwent duodenal biopsy to confirm a possible diagnosis of CD. Twelve patients were positive for IgA or IgG tTG antibodies, showing an overall prevalence of 1.9%. Only 1 healthy subject (0.8%) had a low level positive reaction for IgA anti-tTG. Among the 12 patients and the healthy subject, only 2 (1 SLE and 1 ulcerative colitis patient) were subsequently confirmed to be affected with CD by positive EMA, HLA, and small bowel biopsy findings. The highest rate of false positives was found in PBC patients (10.4%). For these reasons, serological screening testing for CD is not recommended in CTD patients or in subjects affected with IBD or PBC, unless there is a relevant clinical suspicion of CD.",

Guinea pig tissue transglutaminase has a very broad substrate specificity and therefore is useful for kinetic studies using substrate analogues. Here, we report the expression in Escherichia coli of a hexahistidine-tagged guinea pig liver tissue transglutaminase (His(6)-tTGase) allowing rapid purification by immobilized-metal affinity chromatography. Using this procedure we have obtained the highest reported specific activity (17 U/mg) combined with a high yield (22 mg/L of culture) for recombinant TGase using a single-step purification protocol. Using two independent spectrophotometric assays, we determined that the K(m) value of the recombinant enzyme with the substrate Cbz-Gln-Gly is in the same range as values reported in the literature for the native enzyme. We have thus developed a rapid and reproducible protocol for the preparation of high quality tissue TGase.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue transglutaminase (tTg) has been identified as the major autoantigen in coeliac disease (CD). ELISA methods have been developed for measuring the autoantibody. There are divergent reports on the effects of calcium on the antibody binding to tTg. Furthermore, zinc is a potent inhibitor of tTg. To better understand the role of transglutaminase in CD, we have studied the stability of commercial tTG, the effect of CD serum on tTg-activity and the effects of calcium and zinc on the antibody binding. The inclusion of calcium during the coating of the ELISA plates significantly increases the binding of the antibody, while zinc at physiological concentrations inhibits the binding. Moreover, our results show that commercial guinea pig liver Tg treated with calcium contains at least four major antigenic molecules and is a labile enzyme, which is degraded rapidly by contaminating proteases. Human serum contains anti-proteases that protect the enzyme. Probably, the labile character of commercial tTG explains the divergent reports on the effects of calcium on antibody binding. Finally, antibodies in serum from a CD patient do not seem to inhibit tTg activity. Hypothetically, low, intestinal Zn2+ -levels facilitate Ca2+-activation of tTg, which deamidates gliadin. A complex between tTg and modified gliadin forms the antigen and triggers the immune reaction leading to manifest CD. Hypozincaemia secondary to villous atrophy aggravates the induced disease.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to describe a new model of auxiliary heterotopic partial liver transplantation with portal vein arterialization. Three standard hepatectomies were performed in pigs. The left lateral lobe was surgically resected and portal vein arteriolization constructed by an end-to-side \"Y\" anastomoses between the distal to the celiac axis aorta and the portal vein. The graft was placed in the left iliaca fossa using anastomoses of the donor infrahepatic inferior cava vein end-to-side to the host infrarenal inferior vein and the donor aortic stump with portal vein arteriolization end-to-side to the left iliac artery. After graft reperfusion, the 3 recipients showed intraoperative hypotension, which was treated with fluid administration and vasoactive drugs. At the end of the operation, the graft displayed normal arterial blood flow and good venous drainage. The donor liver graft appeared more red than the host liver, which was due to the increased arterial blood flow. One pig of 3 died at 24 hours after surgery, probably due to hypothermia. However, the other 2 pigs survived the procedure and remained stable. Echographic monitoring showed intrahepatic arterial expansion, which may be the result of high blood pressure due to the arteriolization procedure. We have developed a novel and easy to perform technique that diminishes the number of anastomoses and does not involve vessels from other organs.",

Our aim was to evaluate the usefulness of the serum anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody assay in screening for CD in consecutive NHL patients. In all, 80 consecutive patients (median age 61 years) with a new diagnosis of NHL were included. To compare the frequency of CD and of positive results for the anti-tTG assay, we enrolled 500 blood donors. In all patients serum anti-tTG was determined with two different ELISA: one based on tTG from guinea pig (gp-tTG) and the other based on human recombinant t-TG (h-tTG) as the antigens. Serum anti-endomysial antibodies (EmA) were also assayed. Subjects with positive serum EmA and/or anti-tTG underwent intestinal biopsy for histology study, HLA-DQ phenotype determination, and serum anti-gliadin (AGA) assay. Eight of 80 (10%) NHL patients were positive for anti-tTG ELISA--two of these exclusively for anti-gp-tTG and six for anti-h-tTG (7.5%). None of the 80 NHL patients were positive for serum EmA. The frequency of anti-tTG positivity in the blood donor controls was 2/500 (0.4%), significantly lower than that observed in the NHL patients (P < 0.0001). Both these blood donors were found to have CD. Only in one anti-h-tTG-positive NHL patient was there intestinal mucosa atrophy, and follow-up confirmed a CD diagnosis (CD frequency in NHL patients is 1.2%; versus blood donors: P = 0.4). In all the other seven anti-tTG-positive NHL patients a normal intestinal architecture was found, although, inflammatory infiltration of the lamina propria was observed in four patients. No anti-tTG-positive NHL patients, including the subject diagnosed as having CD, had a family history of CD, and all had normal weight and no signs of malabsorption. Anti-tTG false positive results were associated with a higher frequency of serum autoantibody positivity and T-cell type NHL. In conclusion, NHL patients the anti-tTG assay often gives discordant data with the EmA assay, with a high frequency of anti-tTG false positive results for CD diagnosis.",

Laboratories depending on immunofluorescence assays are faced with an increasing workload using a labour-intensive test, and an alternative to this test has been sought. This study compares tissue transglutaminase (TTG) and endomysium antibodies (EMA) in a routine clinical laboratory situation. An immunofluorescence IgA EMA test was compared with a guinea pig TTG antibody ELISA for 816 unselected requests for gut antibody screening. Discrepant results were investigated more fully using a variety of human source TTG antigen kits. Guinea pig TTG ELISA and EMA assays showed agreement for 93.6% of samples. Four samples were misclassified and 48 samples gave false positive TTG results. Study of 46 EMA samples (this group included 39 of the 'discrepant' negative EMA/positive guinea pig TTG group) using three different human purified and/or recombinant TTG sources showed that 42 patients had no TTG antibodies using human sources, three were misclassified and one patient had negative EMA and positive TTG results that could not be readily explained. Further study of 32 EMA positive samples showed almost complete agreement between the human source TTG kits. We can recommend the replacement of EMA with ELISA for TTG antibodies for the routine screening for coeliac disease, but all positive TTG antibodies should still be followed up with IgA EMA and samples should be screened for IgA deficiency.",

To assess the clinical utility of a newly developed kit for antibodies to human recombinant tissue transglutaminase (hu-anti-tTG) in a large population of patients undergoing intestinal biopsy for suspected intestinal disorders. We evaluated 426 serum samples from consecutive adult patients (250 from untreated coeliac disease patients and 176 from individuals in whom a diagnosis of coeliac disease had been excluded), obtained at the time of intestinal biopsy. Samples were tested for immunoglobulin A (IgA) hu-anti-tTG by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay, IgA endomysial antibodies (EmA) by indirect immunofluorescence and IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. A sub-group of samples was also assessed for a guinea-pig-based anti-tissue transglutaminase. According to the cut-off for hu-anti-tTG, the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 91%, 96%, 97% and 87%, respectively. Simultaneous determination of EmA showed values of 86%, 100%, 100% and 83% for the same parameters. Although 19 coeliac disease patients (7.6%) were negative for EmA and hu-anti-tTG, both tests rendered superior statistical values to antigliadin antibody tests. At diagnosis, IgA deficiency was detected in 11 patients, but both assays were able to detect samples with mild to moderate deficiency. The comparison of hu-anti-tTG with EmA showed excellent concordance between the tests (kappa statistic, 0.85). Discordance was observed in 20 samples from coeliac disease patients (8%) and in nine samples from controls (5%). Fifteen samples had an EmA-negative but hu-anti-tTG-positive serology, and five showed the converse pattern. Comparison of human recombinant and guinea-pig tests showed concordant results in 96% of cases. The quantitative determination of hu-anti-tTG type IgA using a commercial enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay kit was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of coeliac disease. Our results in a large population of patients with a clinical condition suggestive of the disorder demonstrated that the test can be used to detect a substantial number of patients otherwise unrecognized by IgA EmA.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) was recently identified as the major autoantigen in coeliac disease. The aim of this multicentre study was to evaluate the impact of a new immunoenzymatic assay for the detection of IgA anti-tGT antibodies. Seventy four Italian and French clinical laboratories participated in this study; anti-tTG IgA with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method using guinea pig liver extract as the coating antigen, anti-endomysium IgA autoantibodies (EMA), and total serum IgA were determined in 7948 patients, 1162 of whom had coeliac disease (737 untreated cases and 425 on a gluten free diet). A proportion of the sera were then sent to a reference laboratory for anti-tTG retesting with an ELISA method using recombinant human tTG antigen. Seven thousand four hundred and fifty eight (93.8%) sera were EMA/antiguinea pig tTG concordant (positive or negative); 490 (6.2%) were non-concordant. The sensitivity of EMA and antiguinea pig tTG in the 737 untreated patients with coeliac disease was 92.1% and 94.8%, respectively, and the specificity was 99.8% and 99.2%, respectively. Retesting of the discordant sera showed that of the 162 sera classified as EMA negative/antiguinea pig tTG positive, only 49 were positive for human recombinant anti-tTG, and that 39 of these were also EMA positive. Furthermore, of the 36 sera classified as EMA positive/antiguinea pig tTG negative, only two were confirmed as EMA positive. The antiguinea pig tTG assay is more sensitive but less specific than EMA, whereas the antihuman recombinant tTG assay is far more specific and just as sensitive as antiguinea pig tTG. Testing for EMA presents considerable interpretative problems and is difficult to standardise.",

        "Abstract": "In western and northern but not southern Europe, the prevalence of coeliac disease among patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is higher than in the general population. We analysed the prevalence of coeliac disease among patients with PBC in Poland, a central European country. In 115 patients with PBC, immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against guinea-pig tissue transglutaminase (tTGA), monkey endomysium (EMA) and gliadin (AGA) were determined. In patients positive for tTGA and/or EMA, the DNA typing of HLA-DQB gene and small-bowel biopsy were performed. IgA EMA was found in one patient with PBC (0.9%, 95% CI 0-2.5%). tTGA was detected in seven patients (6%, 95% CI 1.8-10.3%). Small-bowel biopsy showed flat mucosa in one subject, who was EMA positive/tTGA negative/AGA negative, and normal histology in four tTGA-positive/EMA-negative patients. In the latter four patients, the positive tTGA result was caused by IgA reactivity to proteins other than transglutaminase. Prevalence of coeliac disease in our 115 patients with PBC was 0.9% (95% CI 0-1.9%). In one patient with silent coeliac disease presenting with the HLA-DQ2 allele, introduction of a gluten-free diet was followed by improvement in liver function tests, improvement in histology of the distal duodenum, and disappearance of EMA. Our results from Poland do not confirm a high prevalence of coeliac disease in PBC patients. Guinea-pig liver transglutaminase immunolinked assay cannot be used as a screening test for coeliac disease in PBC patients. A gluten-free diet may be helpful in restoration of liver function in patients with such an association.",

Four commercial enzyme-linked immunoassay kits using human tissue transglutaminase as antigen were used to measure autoantibody levels in serum samples from untreated adult coeliacs (n = 32). They were from a series of 130 cases diagnosed between 1997 and 1999 and chosen to bias the group towards subjects with negative autoantibodies when measured with guinea pig tissue transglutaminase as antigen. Samples from 38 control subjects (biased towards false-positive levels with guinea pig antigen) were used to compare specificity. We also assessed if human antigen kits could differentiate between levels in normal subjects and in selective IgA deficiency. Sensitivity for coeliac disease in this selected group using the human antigen kits ranged from 88% to 100%. Three kits showed significantly higher specificity (82%-97%, P < 0.05) than the guinea pig antigen kit (71%) for the samples studied. No kit achieved complete separation between normal autoantibody levels and lower levels in selective IgA deficiency. All human antigen kits showed significantly higher sensitivity for coeliac disease compared to guinea pig antigen (P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curves confirmed the superior diagnostic accuracy of the human antigen kits.",

        "Abstract": "Tissue transglutaminase was identified as the main autoantigen in coeliac disease (CD) but enzyme immunoassays applying the commercially available antigen from guinea pig liver show insufficient specificity and sensitivity for diagnosis as compared with endomysium antibodies (EmA). The aim of this present study was to develop a new method for the cloning and expression of human tissue transglutaminase (hu-tTG) and to test hu-tTG in the serological diagnosis of CD. Hu-tTG was cloned and expressed using a baculovirus system and SF9 insect cells. The enzyme carried a C-terminal His tag allowing efficient affinity purification from cell lysates. The recognition of hu-tTG by human sera was checked by using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For this, 35 patients with active CD were compared with 144 controls (18 patients with bioptically excluded CD, 89 blood donors, 30 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and seven patients with cystic fibrosis). The ELISA using hu-tTG showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 98.6%. Titres of antibodies against hu-tTG (anti-hu-tTG) were positively correlated with EmA titres. All results negative for EmA were also negative for anti-hu-tTG. There were, however, EmA positive results up to a titre of 1 : 80 below the cut-off for anti-hu-tTG. For comparison, antibodies against guinea pig tissue transglutaminase (anti-gp-tTG) were determined in parallel. All patients with anti-hu-tTG below the cut-off were also negative for anti-gp-tTG. However, there were eight patients positive for anti-hu-tTG but negative for anti-gp-tTG. The new test reaches and even exceeds diagnostic efficiency of EmA for coeliac diagnosis.",

However, a high rate of false-positive results has been reported in some patient series with diseases known to be associated with CD. Moreover, tTG is a ubiquitous, multifunctional enzyme, overexpressed in experimental models of heart failure. Therefore, we assessed the specificity of tTGA assays in a large series of EmA-negative patients with end-stage heart failure. We studied 288 patients with end-stage heart failure and 60 blood donors. No subject had clinical evidence of CD or IgA deficiency, and all were EmA negative. Serum IgA and IgG tTGA were measured by means of commercial kits using as substrate, either guinea pig or recombinant human tTG. Blocking studies and Western blots were also performed using recombinant human tTG. All blood donor sera were IgA tTGA negative. IgA tTGA positivity was observed in 47.6% and 49.1% of patients with heart failure using, respectively, guinea pig tTG and recombinant human tTG as substrates. Preincubation of positive sera with recombinant human tTG resulted in 81% blocking of IgA tTGA in immunoassay. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of antibodies against recombinant human tTG. IgA tTGA-positive sera were also IgG tTGA positive. IgA and IgG tTGA occur in a large number of EmA-negative patients with end-stage heart failure, and their presence is unlikely to be caused by concomitant CD.",

        "Abstract": "Serological screening for celiac disease (CD) can detect a large number of otherwise undiagnosed patients based on the sequential evaluation of serological tests and intestinal biopsy. The aim of this study was to compare the screening value for CD of two different protocols for the same community-based population. We screened 1,000 consecutive subjects (497 women, age range 16-71 yr) attending a centralized laboratory for obligatory prenuptial blood tests. Serum samples obtained from all subjects were processed using two different protocols: I) a three-level classic screening consisting of the parallel use of IgG and IgA antigliadin antibodies as first level, followed by endomysial antibodies and total serum IgA for positive patients, and finally, intestinal biopsy of positive patients; and 2) a study screening protocol consisting of the parallel use of a commercial guinea pig antitissue transglutaminase antibody and total serum IgA as first line, endomysial antibodies (type IgA and/or IgG) for positive patients, and finally, intestinal biopsy. The classic screening protocol identified five subjects who were eligible for intestinal biopsy, which confirmed the presence of CD in all (prevalence 5.0 x 1,000, 95% CI = 1.6-11.6). Using the study algorithm, we detected seven new patients including the five patients detected by the first protocol (prevalence 7.0 x 1,000, 95% CI = 2.8-14.4). The two additional patients diagnosed using the proposed algorithm had positive IgG antigliadin antibodies and normal total serum IgA and were not detected by the classic protocol. Both patients were endomysial antibodies positive. The comparative analysis showed that the classic approach was more expensive (U.S. $4,687 per new patient detected) compared with the proposed study algorithm (U.S. $3,006). Our data showed that a new screening protocol using antitissue transglutaminase as first line followed by endomysial antibodies is a cost-effective screening and yielded more realistic figures of prevalence for CD in a community setting than the classic three-level sequential evaluation using antigliadin antibodies.",

Immunoglobulin A endomysial, human and guinea pig tissue transglutaminase antibodies, and immunoglobulin A and G gliadin antibodies were sought in 255 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Immunoglobulin A endomysial and human tissue transglutaminase antibodies were positive in nine patients (seven primary biliary cirrhosis, one autoimmune cholangitis, and one primary sclerosing cholangitis), whose duodenal biopsy results showed villous atrophy consistent with CD. Two of these patients had a malabsorption syndrome, and one had iron-deficiency anemia. Clinical and biochemical signs of cholestasis did not improve after gluten withdrawal in the three patients with severe liver disease. A longer follow-up of the six celiac patients with mild liver damage is needed to clarify whether gluten restriction can contribute to slow down the progression of liver disease. The high prevalence of CD (3.5%) in autoimmune cholestasis suggests that serological screening for CD should be routinely performed in such patients by immunoglobulin A endomysial or human tissue transglutaminase antibodies.",

This study compared the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of an immunofluorescence method for anti-endomysial antibodies (EmAs) and two anti-tTG ELISAs, one using guinea pig tTG (gp-tTG) and the other human tTG (h-tTG) as antigen, in consecutive patients investigated for suspected celiac disease (CD). We studied 207 consecutive patients (99 men, 108 women; age range, 17-84 years) who underwent intestinal biopsy for suspected CD. Patients presented with one or more of the following: weight loss, anemia, chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, alternating bowel habits, constipation, pain in the joints, and dermatitis. At entry to the study, an intestinal biopsy was performed and a serum sample was taken for IgA EmAs, anti-gp-tTG, and anti-h-tTG. Intestinal histology showed that 24 patients had partial or total villous atrophy; in these patients the diagnosis of CD was confirmed by follow-up. The remaining 183 patients had villous/crypt ratios that were within our laboratory's reference values and were considered controls. Serum EmAs, anti-gp-tTG, and anti-h-tTG were positive in all 24 CD patients; in the control group, none were positive for serum EmAs, but 15 of 183 (8.2%) were positive for anti-gp-tTG, and 6 of 183 (3.3%) were positive for anti-h-tTG. Sensitivity was 100% for all assays, whereas specificity was 100% for the EmA, 92% for the anti-gp-tTG, and 97% for the anti-h-tTG assay. The negative predictive value was 100% for all assays; the positive predictive value was 100% for the EmA, 80% [95% confidence interval (CI), 65-95%] for the anti-h-tTG (P = 0.03 vs EmA) and 60% (95% CI, 44-76%) for the anti-gp-tTG assay (P = 0.0002 vs EmA). Areas (95% CIs) under the ROC curves were 0.987 (0.97-1.0) for anti-h-tTG and 0.965 (0.94-0.99) for anti-gp-tTG. Most of the patients testing false positive for anti-tTG had Crohn disease or chronic liver disease. Although both anti-tTG ELISAs showed optimum sensitivity, their lack of specificity yielded positive predictive values significantly lower than those for the EmA assay.",

A 11-year-old girl followed due to type 1 diabetes mellitus, celiac disease and euthyroid lymphocytic thyroiditis at diagnosis. Two years after the initial evaluation, thyroid-stimulating hormone was suppressed with normal free T4; nine months later, a biochemical evolution to hypothyroidism with thyroid-stimulating hormone-receptor autoantibodies elevation was seen; the patient remained always asymptomatic. Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with the recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone -receptor, and then exposed to the patient's serum; it was estimated a 'moderate' blocking activity of these thyroid-stimulating hormone-receptor autoantibodies, and concomitantly excluded stimulating action. In this case, the acknowledgment of the blocking activity of the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone-receptor autoantibodies, supported the hypothesis of a multifactorial aetiology of the hypothyroidism, which in the absence of the in vitro tests, we would consider only as a consequence of the destructive process associated to lymphocytic thyroiditis.",

In this study, the effect of T cell-induced mucosal damage on jejunal epithelial ion transport, muscle contractility, and neuronal ACh release was assessed in Ussing chambers, organ baths, and a specialized perfusion apparatus, respectively. Time-matched control mice received hamster serum containing irrelevant antibodies. Jejunal segments from anti-CD3-treated mice displayed a significantly elevated epithelial baseline short-circuit current (which indicates increased ion transport) and a concomitant reduction in responsiveness to prosecretory stimuli (nerve stimulation, carbachol, and forskolin). Longitudinal smooth muscle displayed altered spontaneous contractile activity, length-tension relationships, and carbachol-stimulated contraction in tissues excised from mice 20 and 40 h posttreatment. Anti-CD3 treatment did not affect stimulated ACh release from myenteric plexus neurons. We conclude that specific T cell activation via anti-CD3 antibody results in dramatic alterations in jejunal epithelial and smooth muscle function. Such T cell-induced changes in intestinal function may contribute to the symptomatology of T cell-mediated enteropathies, including graft-versus-host disease, celiac disease, and idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease.",

        "Abstract": "Selected portions of the prevertebral and paravertebral sympathetic and vagal parasympathetic nervous systems have been examined in the genetically diabetic Chinese hamster, an experimental animal model of diabetic gastrointestinal disease. The prevertebral sympathetic superior mesenteric/celiac ganglia, which provide much of the sympathetic innervation of the alimentary tract, developed large numbers of markedly dilated axons, many of which had the ultrastructural features of neuroaxonal dystrophy. Dystrophic axons, many involving presynaptic axonal elements, were increased in frequency in the prevertebral superior mesenteric/celiac ganglia, but not in the paravertebral superior cervical sympathetic ganglia, of chronically diabetic hamsters in comparison with age-matched controls. Dystrophic axons contained substance P- and gastrin-releasing peptide (gastrin-releasing peptide/bombesin)-like staining but were not labeled by antisera directed against vasoactive intestinal peptide, dynorphin-B, somatostatin, leu- and met-enkephalin and neuropeptide tyrosine. Substance P and gastrin-releasing peptide/bombesin containing subpopulations of presynaptic elements in prevertebral sympathetic ganglia are thought to participate in local reflex control of bowel motility and lesions preferentially involving these elements may contribute to bowel dysfunction. Immunohistologic techniques failed to demonstrate dystrophic axons in the superior cervical ganglia. Although morphometric studies failed to show significant axon loss in the abdominal vagus of chronically diabetic Chinese hamsters, evidence of markedly diminished numbers of axons comprising each Schwann cell unit and regenerative collections of Schwann cell processes devoid of axons are consistent with the participation of parasympathetic elements in the pathogenesis of alimentary dysfunction in this model system. These results suggest that selective subpopulations of neuropeptide containing axons are vulnerable to the diabetic condition and that these abnormalities may lead to physiologic dysfunction.",

        "Title": "Sugar absorption by small bowel biopsy samples from patients with primary lactase deficiency and with adult celiac disease.",
        "Abstract": "The present study was undertaken to compare the 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3MG) absorption by jejunal biopsies from normal human subjects (N = 3) with that by the jejunum of the rat (N = 8) and of the hamster (N = 8), and to examine whether jejunal biopsies from normal subjects (N = 3), patients with primary lactase deficiency (N = 5) and from patients with celiac sprue (N = 5) follow the same pattern of sugar absorption as usually observed in vivo. The results indicate that under the conditions of our experiments the estimated affinity of carrier for 3MG (ie, apparent Km) in the biopsies from normal subjects did not differ significantly from that in rat or hamster jejunum. The estimated capacity of carriers for 3MG absorption (ie, Vmax) appeared to be similar in biopsies from normal subjects and in hamster jejunum, but significantly lower in rat jejunum. There was no difference in apparent Km between the biopsies from normal subjects and those from the patients with lactase deficiency. Although the Vmax for the lactase deficient patients was substantially higher than that for the normal subjects, the difference was not statistically significant. The absorption of 3MG by the biopsies from patients with celiac sprue did not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics and was compatible with that of passive diffusion or low saturation conditions. Since the intracellular concentration of 3MG in all biopsies from celiac patients exceeded the concentration of the media, sugar transport could not have occurred by diffusion, and it is concluded that the absence of Michaelis-Menten kinetics was the result of low saturation conditions. This active transport with low saturation kinetics in patients with celiac disease suggests that in these patients not only the number of functioning carrier molecules is diminished but also the affinity of the existing carrier for sugar molecule is reduced. This situation, at least in some patients, seems to improve after treatment with gluten-free diet.",
